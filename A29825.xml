            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the year 1668. I left the large and pleaſant City of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and went by land to <hi>Yarmouth</hi> a Port Town in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> at the mouth of the River <hi>Hierus</hi> or <hi>Yare;</hi> large, fairly built and populous, very conſiderable for the great Herring fiſhing in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, and the commerce it maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Streights; <hi>Baltick, Britiſh</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Seas: With <hi>Italians, French, Spaniards, Dutch, Danes,</hi> and <hi>Swedes.</hi> I was here nobly entertained by that worthy and obliging perſon, Sr. <hi>Iames Iohnſon,</hi> who alſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh't me with letters of Credit, to <hi>Amſterdam, Franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, Venice</hi> and <hi>Vienna;</hi> Whereby I was readily and handſomely accommodated in all Parts where I had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards occaſion to travel.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:57700:4"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 14. about ſix a clock at night I went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board the <hi>Angel-Ketch</hi> in <hi>Yarmouth</hi> Road, a Veſſel of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 55 Tuns, and we immediately ſet ſayl for <hi>Rotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam;</hi> we left St. <hi>Nicholas-Sand</hi> on the Larboard, and after that the <hi>Nowles,</hi> a new Sand, not taken notice of to be raiſed above twelve years before. We kept our courſe all night, Eaſt and by South and Eaſt South Eaſt. The Sea burned at the head of the Ship at the beginning of the night, but the Moon riſing there appeared nothing but froth. In the morning we diſcovered <hi>Graveſandt</hi> Steeple. It is the cuſtom upon all this coaſt to ſend out Pylot-boats continually to meet all Ships at Sea, and furniſh them with Pylots to bring them through the ſands, and no Ship is to refuſe one: Having taken in our Pylot, we ſoon diſcovered <hi>Goréé</hi> Steeple, and then the <hi>Briel.</hi> We entred the River <hi>Moſa,</hi> or <hi>Maes,</hi> a Large and noble Stream, which ariſing in the Mountaines of <hi>Vauge,</hi> or <hi>Vogeſus,</hi> paſſing by <hi>Verdun, Dinant, Namur, Liege, Maeſtricht, Ruremond, Venlo,</hi> and many conſiderable Places, doth here fall into the Ocean, we had a very pleaſant paſſage up the River, ſayling by many neat Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, as <hi>Maeſe-ſluys, Schedam, Delfshaven,</hi> and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome rowes of Trees upon the ſhore, and arrived at <hi>Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam</hi> about ſix at night. This is one of the three chief paſſages by Sea into <hi>Holland,</hi> the other being by <hi>Fluſhing</hi> and the <hi>Texell.</hi> The neareſt cut out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> into <hi>Holland</hi> is from <hi>Laiſtoffe</hi> Point to <hi>Grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandt,</hi> which is 28 Leagues, and the deepeſt part of the Sea is about 28 Fathoms. There lay two of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Ships in <hi>Holland</hi> at that time near <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> the <hi>Crane</hi> and the <hi>Waſſenaer;</hi> this latter built in lieu of that in which Admiral <hi>Opdam</hi> was blown up, fighting againſt his Royal Highneſs the Duke of <hi>Yorke.</hi> The Heads or Keyes between which we entred the towne by water are
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57700:4"/> handſome, and Ships of great burden are received into the middle of divers ſtreets without difficulty, (their Channels being deep and large) the houſes are well built, and the town Populous, they have an Exchange or place for Merchants to meet at, the ſtreets are ſo clean that the Women goe about in white Slippers, they being paved with Bricks laid edgwiſe. The <hi>Landthuiſe</hi> hath a fair front. In the great Church the Organs, the Tower and the Monument of <hi>De wit,</hi> upon the Bridge the Statue of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> as alſo the houſe where he was born, and the Pleaſure boats of the States are worth the ſeeing. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then the time of their <hi>Kermis</hi> or Faire, there were playes acted and many rarities ſhewn, as <hi>Lions, Leopards,</hi> &amp;c, and a great noiſe was made about a tall Woman to be ſhewn of ſeven foot high; but the Boor of <hi>Leckerkir'k,</hi> not far from this town, was higher. <hi>Parſons</hi> and <hi>Evans,</hi> porters to King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, did alſo exceed her, but I have ſeldom heard of any that was taller than <hi>Martin Wierwſki</hi> a Polander, who at the age of forty two years was preſented to the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> the ſecond, as a rarity of nature, and was full eight foot high, whoſe picture, as big as the life, I ſaw, near to the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent at <hi>Vienna</hi> in <hi>Auſtria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Rotterdam</hi> I paſſed by <hi>Overſchee</hi> to <hi>Delft,</hi> by the Powderhouſe, which is a handſome one, built now at ſome diſtance from the towne to prevent the like acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent which befell when the former took fire and blew up part of the town. The <hi>Piazza</hi> or market-place is a very fair one, having the front of the town houſe at one end of it, and the high ſteeple of the new Church at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In the old Church, <hi>Van-Tromps</hi> Tombe is very well carved upon the ſide of the Wall, himſelf lying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Canon encompaſſed with Arms and trophies. In the middle Iſle of the new Church there is a noble
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57700:5"/> monument, the Tombe of <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> together with his Wife and Son, Prince <hi>Maurice;</hi> his <hi>Statua</hi> is in armour with his Dog at his feet, and four Obelisks are ſupported by ten Marble pillars. In a houſe of this Town there were ſhewn me in a Wall the marks of the bullets ſhot at Prince <hi>William,</hi> who was thereby murthered 1584. and in another Church which was broad and ſpacious I ſaw a handſome Tomb for Sr. <hi>Charles Morgans</hi> Lady, and the Monument of <hi>Peter Hein</hi> the Admiral, who took the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Silver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleet.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hague, Haga Comitis,</hi> the ancient place of Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Counts of <hi>Holland,</hi> and now of the States ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; is about an hours-going diſtant from <hi>Delft;</hi> in which paſſage, at ſome diſtance, we had a ſight of two of the Prince of <hi>Orange's</hi> houſes. This place is well built; the Prince's Court handſome; The <hi>Piazza</hi> by it full of green trees; many fair Houſes. The Courſe where the Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es meet, the Pall-mall, the Wood, the Park, do much beautifie it, and the way from hence to <hi>Scheveling,</hi> from whence his Majeſty returned into <hi>England,</hi> is very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, it being a ſtreight way cut through the Sand-hills, and paved with Brick for three miles, having on each hand four or five rows of Trees, and <hi>Scheveling</hi> Steeple at the end of it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hague</hi> and <hi>Mad rid</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> are accounted the greateſt Villages, or open unwalled places, in <hi>Europe,</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have thought it more honour to be Maſters of the greateſt Village, than of a place which, if it were walled, would come ſhort of many Cities; but this may prove a dangerous reſolution, for formerly upon this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, <hi>Martin van Roſſem,</hi> Captain to the Duke of <hi>Gueldres,</hi> ſacked the <hi>Hague;</hi> and it was lately in the like danger when the <hi>French</hi> Forces lay at <hi>Utrecht</hi> and <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:57700:5"/> if they had forced a paſſage into that part of <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leyden</hi> is three hours or three <hi>Dutch</hi> miles from the <hi>Hague,</hi> at preſent one of the neareſt Towns in <hi>Europe;</hi> Well built, hath divers large Streets, beautified with rowes of Trees, and the water paſſing through the middle of them, and alſo well fortified after the modern way; I took notice of that Antiquity called <hi>Hengiſt</hi> Caſtle, or the <hi>Berg,</hi> ſaid to be built by <hi>Hengiſt</hi> the <hi>Saxon,</hi> and went up to the top thereof: Upon the top there is now an Arbour, and a Maze or Labyrinth round it, and a Well, out of which, they told us, they took a Fiſh alive when the Town was almoſt famiſhed during the ſiege, which was ſhewed to the Enemy over the wall, endeavouring to make their condition to appear better than it was, and to diſhearten the beſiegers. There are now handſome ſtairs from the top to the bottom, and a good houſe built by it, where they have their publick ſales and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments. But a nobler Antiquity lieth under the Sea, than any above ground; not far from hence near <hi>Calwyck</hi> is a ſquare fortreſs called <hi>Arx Britannica,</hi> built by <hi>Caligu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la;</hi> in the declining of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire ruined in part by the <hi>Normans,</hi> and afterwards neglected, &amp; over whelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Sea. But in ſome years, and great retire of the Sea, the ruines have been diſcovered, and many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Antiquities brought from it, ſome having this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription <hi>Ex. Ger. Inf. ex Germania inferiori.</hi> The <hi>Stadthuiſe</hi> hath a fair front towards the ſtreet. In the Anatomy Schools are a very great number of <hi>Skeletons.</hi> Two legs of an <hi>Elephant.</hi> The <hi>Skeleton</hi> of a young <hi>Whale,</hi> of a <hi>Horſe, Deer, Cow, Cat, Fox,</hi> and many other Animals; divers <hi>Skeletons</hi> of Men and Women, ſome bodies preſerved with their Muſcles, and one intire, the fleſh, skin and all parts defended from corruption. I ſaw alſo here what Monſieur <hi>de Bils</hi> pretended towards
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57700:6"/> the preſervation of Bodies, but more accurately after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards at Dr. <hi>Ruiſch</hi> his houſe at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> The Phyſick-garden, although but ſmall, is well filled with Plants, where are alſo many other both natural, and artificiall Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities to be ſeen, and many ſorts of <hi>Optick glaſſes.</hi> Near the garden are the Schools built of Brick with the <hi>Officina Elzeviriana</hi> on the top. In the Churches I ſaw the Monuments of many famous men. There is a Picture in the Chamber for the Burgermaſters, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the day of Judgment, drawn by <hi>Lucas van Leyden,</hi> ſo much eſteemed that, it is ſaid, the Emperour <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphus</hi> would have given for it as many Ducats of Gold as would have covered it. The Table alſo upon which <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> wrought whilſt he was a Taylor, is a Curioſity, becauſe he proved afterwards ſo conſiderable a diſturber of <hi>Germany,</hi> and came to be King of the <hi>Anabaptiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This City endured a hard ſiege by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> forces, and they were reduced unto great extremity, but they ſaved themſelves by overflowing the Country, and ſo forcing the Enemies to make away with great loſs; and afterwards coyned a memorial-Medall with this Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ut Senacherib à</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>ſic Hiſpani a Leydae noctu fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerunt.</hi> 1574.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Leyden</hi> I came to <hi>Haerlem,</hi> a neat City, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly ſeated and having a Grove near it. The great Church is eſteemed the largeſt in <hi>Holland,</hi> with a very high Lanthorn upon it. Within are many Inſcriptions and Monuments, moſt of which are tranſcribed and ſet down in <hi>Gotfr. Hegenitii Itinerarium Hollandicum.</hi> In the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce's houſe are all the Earles of <hi>Holland</hi> Painted upon the wall, and in the Garden in the Summer-houſe, the Pict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of <hi>Laurentius Coſterus,</hi> who is ſaid to have firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the art of Printing in this Town; but others attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57700:6"/> it to <hi>Johannes Gottenberg,</hi> a <hi>German.</hi> On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide there is a Picture of a Ship with Saws, in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the manner how <hi>Damiata</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> was formerly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by thoſe of this Town, who, as they report, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied <hi>Frederick Barbaroſſa</hi> in an expedition againſt the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and when the men of <hi>Peluſium</hi> or <hi>Damiata</hi> had chamed up their Port, by this invention of faſtning ſtrong Saws to the keels of their Ships, they cut the chains in ſunder, and ſo took the Town. In the rooms are very good Paintings by <hi>Hemskerk,</hi> and <hi>Goltzius,</hi> as his <hi>Prometheus</hi> and other Peeces; but <hi>Cornelius van Haerlem</hi> moſt delighted me, in his peeces of <hi>Herods</hi> kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Innocent Children; his feaſt of the Gods, in which <hi>Vulcans foot</hi> is eſteemed at a great rate; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Picture of a Frier and a Nun at a Collation, not inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the reſt.</p>
            <p>The old Mens houſe, or an Hoſpital for ſixty aged perſons, is large and handſome; having a good Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drangle and a Garden in it. The Hoſpital alſo for the ſick is very cleanly kept.</p>
            <p>Here I firſt ſaw the manner of puniſhing Malefact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours by whipping them with rods, which is more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere than I imagined; they lead them to a Poſt upon a ſcaffold, their hands tyed and by a pully drawn up as high as they can be extended, and then an Iron faſtned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their waſt to keep them ſteady; in which ſtretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out poſture they receive ſometimes fifty or ſixty ſtripes or more, according to the merit of their offence.</p>
            <p>Not far from this place there is a great Water, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Lake called <hi>Haerlem Meere</hi> about twenty miles in length, which is frozen over in hard Winters, and men ſwiftly travel over it by ſliding, or in ſleds. When <hi>Haer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> was beſieged there was a Naval ſight upon it; The <hi>Dutch</hi> having about an hundred and fifty Veſſels, and the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57700:7"/> 
               <hi>Spaniards</hi> not many fewer. The Town was afterwards taken by Compoſition, but ſuch cruelty was uſed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that they have not yet forgot it.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Haerlem</hi> I went to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> a City at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent for Riches, Trade, Shipping, fair Streets, and pleaſant habitations, ſcarce yielding to any other of the World. It is ſeated upon the River <hi>Ye,</hi> and hath its name, as 'tis reported, from a Caſtle appertaining long ſince to the Lords of <hi>Amſtel,</hi> to whom this place alſo belonged: At the beginning, the ſeat of a few fiſhermen; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards increaſing, it received many priviledges from the Counts of <hi>Holland,</hi> and was made a Town or City by the favour of their Grants and Charters. In the year 1470. it was walled about with a Brick-wall, to defend it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Citizens of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> they having been in great danger to have fallen into their hands, if thoſe of <hi>Utrecht</hi> had purſued their victories. In few Months after alſo, the whole Town was almoſt reduced to Aſhes by fire, but by the increaſe of their Traffick they eaſily overcame theſe loſſes, waded through all difficulties, and rendred good ſervices to their Counts, and received the honour afterwards from <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour to have the Imperiall Crown over their Armes, which are three <hi>Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> on a <hi>Pale</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the year 1525. <hi>Gelen,</hi> ſent from the new King of <hi>Munſter,</hi> paſſed through <hi>Frieſland</hi> and came to this City; where having made a party, and communicated his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, he reſolved to ſurprize the Town by night, at the time of the ſounding of the Bell; to which intent they were already entred the Market place, had ſet upon the Town houſe: and cut in pieces thoſe who reſiſted them. When by great providence the rope to the great Bell was taken away; the Magiſtrates had notice of it, and cauſed all the ſtreets and Avenues leading to the Market-place to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57700:7"/> be ſtopped up with Woolſacks and Hopſacks, whereby they were hindred in their deſign of taking the Town by night, and the next morning their number being diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be inconſiderable, they were ſet upon, driven into the <hi>Stadthuis,</hi> and defeated.</p>
            <p>Of late years this City is mightily encreaſed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed with a new Wall, and fortified after the modern way. The new Streets are large and uniform: and the whole Town being in a low Marſhy ground, the water is let in through all the conſiderable Streets. The River <hi>Amſtel</hi> paſſeth through the City, being let in under a handſome well-contrived Bridge of Eleven Arches, which is ſo built as to make part of the Wall and Rampart, and is 26 paces broad. The whole Town is built upon Piles, or high Firr-trees, driven down perpendicularly into the Earth ſo thick together, that nothing more can be forced in between them: And by this means they build Houſes in the Sea, and lay Foundations ſtrong enough to ſupport the greateſt Buildings whatſoever, in places where no ſolid bottom is to be found. But they muſt needs be at a great expence and labour before they can lay the firſt Stone: And the number of Trees required to each Foundation is conſiderable; ſince for the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of one Tower or Steeple alone, over againſt the Church of St. <hi>Katherine,</hi> Mr. <hi>J. de Parivall,</hi> who wrote <hi>Les Delices de la Hollande,</hi> reckoneth that there was ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into the ground a <hi>Forreſt,</hi> as he calls it, of Six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand three hundred and thirty four great Trees. About this manner of work, for the fixing their Foundations, I ſaw them employed in divers places, particularly at the <hi>Eaſt-India-houſe,</hi> and at a place where a <hi>Lutheran</hi> Church was then deſigned to be built, So that it was not improbably ſaid, <hi>That if a man could ſee all under this City, he could hardly behold a greater Forreſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:57700:8"/>
            <p>The <hi>Stadthuis</hi> or <hi>Town-houſe,</hi> is the nobleſt Building in all theſe Countries. A Pile of Freeſtone of an hundred and ten paces in Front, being larger than the Magnified Front of the Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s at <hi>Rome,</hi> and eighty one paces deep, or on the ſides. The Chambers in it, the Pictures and Statues, are worthy to be ſeen and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The firſt Room on the right hand, or <hi>Judgment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> where the Malefactors receive their Sentence, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with large Statues, hanging down their heads in mournful poſtures, as if concerned or grieving at what was then pronounced. The Floors are of Marble; the Roofs are richly gil't and painted. Upon the top of all ſtands <hi>Atlas</hi> or <hi>Columlus,</hi> holding a Globe upon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der made of Copper, of about ten foot Diameter, which is as large perhaps as any Ball or Globe whatſoever em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to this ornamental uſe. That upon St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s at <hi>Rome,</hi> as having been in it, I judge to be leſs; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that at <hi>Florence.</hi> The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Ornament to the Tower of their <hi>Moſques,</hi> is three Balls one above another, and an half Moon over them, but they are leſs by far, at leaſt ſuch as I have ſeen: and by relation from Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, the largeſt of the three noble gilded Balls at <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco</hi> are inferiour to this. But I will ſay nothing more of this great building, the <hi>Stadthuis,</hi> ſince there is a peculiar deſcription of it in Folio, with Cuts and Figures of the moſt remarkable Curioſities in it. The <hi>Exchange</hi> is fair and large, and above it are Shops: it is very well frequented, and he that cometh after twelve payeth ſix ſtivers.</p>
            <p>Divers of their Churches are fair: In the new Church, the partition with Balliſters of Braſs, and the carved Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, are noble. In the old Church the Tomb of <hi>Van Hulſe</hi> and <hi>Heemskerk</hi> are remarkable. <hi>Heemskerk</hi> did his Country great Services in their firſt attempts upon <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia:</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:57700:8"/> for the King of <hi>Spain</hi> having conſiſcated ſome of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Ships, who traded to his Dominions, which were then the Staple for the <hi>India</hi> Trade. It was reſolved by the permiſſion of Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> and the States, to ſet out a Fleet of eight ſhips for the <hi>Indies;</hi> four of which were to paſs by the way of the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean, and the Cape of <hi>Good-hope:</hi> And the other four were to ſearch a paſſage towards the Kingdoms of <hi>Cathay</hi> and <hi>China</hi> by the North-eaſt, whereby the paſſage alſo into thoſe parts might be expected much ſhorter than that which was known to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this intent theſe four laſt veſſels ſailed out of the <hi>Texel, June</hi> 5. 1594. and returned in <hi>September,</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to proceed by reaſon of the Ice. But upon the relation of the Voyage by <hi>William Barenſon,</hi> there were two other Expeditions afterwards to <hi>Nova Zembla;</hi> in the laſt of which they wintered there, and <hi>Barenſon</hi> loſt his life. <hi>Heemskerk</hi> was the chief of the twelve which returned from that cold habitation, where none but Bears and Foxes could well endure the Winter, where he had been twice, and afterwards made two rich Voyages into <hi>India.</hi> Upon whoſe happy returns the <hi>Holland Eaſt-India</hi> Company was firſt eſtabliſhed, and a prohibition made for any other of that Country to trade thither for the ſpace of One and twenty years.</p>
            <p>But to proceed to other publick Buildings in this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The <hi>Tuchthuis</hi> or <hi>Raſpelhuis,</hi> or Houſe of Correction for debauched young men, ſuch as are incorrigible and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to Parents or Laws, hath at the entrance of the Gate two Lions bridled, a proper Embleme, with this Inſcription, <hi>Virtutis eſt domare quae cuncti pavent.</hi> This was formerly a Monaſtery belonging to the Nuns of the Order of St. <hi>Clare,</hi> and converted to this uſe 1595. They who are put in, are forced to work and gain their Bread
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57700:9"/> with hard labour. I ſaw thoſe who raſped <hi>Brazil,</hi> having a certain task ſet them every day, work ſo hard, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing naked and in a ſweat, and the duſt of the <hi>Brazil</hi> wood flying upon them, they were all over painted of a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful red colour. Which odd ſight made me call to mind the Phanſie of my Lady Marchioneſs of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> of a Nation wherein the People were of Orange-tawny colour, and the King of Purple.</p>
            <p>They told us that ſome that were committed to their charge, and not to be brought to work by blows, they placed in a large Ciſtern, and let the water in upon them; placing only a Pump by them for their relief, whereby they are forced to labour for their lives, and to free themſelves from drowning. One we ſaw put into a narrow Dungeon, and kept from meat. Some are put into this Houſe for a longer time, ſome for a ſhorter. It hath been a puniſhment for ſuch as have drawn their Daggers, or offered to ſtab any one. And ſome Citizens, though able and rich enough, contrive it ſo, that when their Sons are extravagant and maſterleſs, the Officers ſeize upon them, and carry them into this Houſe, where they are not forced to any hard labour, but kept in till they ſee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſigns of a mending their life.</p>
            <p>This way of Correction may ſeem ſevere to many, yet is not comparable to that which is ſaid to have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly uſed in <hi>Germany.</hi> Particularly at <hi>Colen,</hi> in the <hi>white Tower,</hi> at the North end of the Town, near the <hi>Rhine;</hi> where it is reported, that ſuch Youths who were not otherwiſe to be reclaimed, were in a barbarous manner ſhut up in the <hi>white Tower.</hi> The height and thickneſs of the walls ſecured them from eſcaping, or from their complaints being heard. Near the top was placed out of their reach a loaf of bread, the laſt remedy againſt ſtarving, which while their bold neceſſity forced
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57700:9"/> them to reach at, they executed their laſt ſentence upon themſelves, and miſerably brake their own necks.</p>
            <p>Somewhat like the <hi>Raſpelhuis</hi> is the <hi>Spinhuis,</hi> or Houſe of Correction, for the young women who live looſely, are taken in the night, or can give no account of their living. They are put in for a certain time, according as their fault meriteth, and are bound to make lace, ſew, or employ their time perpetually in ſome honeſt labour.</p>
            <p>Thoſe of the better ſort are permitted to have Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers apart. In one large Room I ſaw about an hundred of them, and ſome very well dreſſed and fine, which was an unexpected ſight to me, and would ſure be more ſtrange to behold in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Weeſhuis,</hi> or Hoſpital for Children, where there are Six hundred Orphans carefully looked after, and well educated.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dolhuis,</hi> or a Houſe for ſuch as are Delirious, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacal, or Melancholical of both Sexes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Gaſthuis,</hi> or Hoſpital for the Sick, being large, and hath a great Revenue.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Mannenhuis,</hi> or Hoſpital for old Men, and ſuch as are no longer able to labour towards their own ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
            <p>Beſides all which, there are great Sums of mony col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected for the poor, ſo that there is not a Begger to be ſeen in the Streets, and upon all aſſignations or appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of meeting at the Tavern, or elſewhere, and upon many other occaſions, whoſoever faileth to come at the exact time, forfeiteth more or leſs to the uſe of the Poor.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Eaſt-India-houſes</hi> are remarkable, and the great Stores of their Commodities, <hi>Cinamon, Green-ginger, Camphire, Pepper, Calecuts, Indico, &amp;c.</hi> The ſhips are of a great burden: their Houſe was then enlarging, although
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57700:10"/> it was great before; and a perfect Town for all Trades within it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Admiralteyt,</hi> or Admiralty where their Stores for War and Shipping are laid up, is encompaſſed with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; near to it there lay then 72 Men of War. In the Houſe we ſaw their Cables, Grapling irons, Pullies, Oars, Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for Powder, Lanthorns for ſhips, &amp;c. At the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the Gate hangeth up a <hi>Canoe</hi> with a man in it, dryed up, ſo as to be preſerved from corruption, and a Paddle in his hand: he was encloſed up to the waſte in the <hi>Canoe,</hi> in ſuch ſort, as the Fiſh-skins, which were the cover to it, being ſo ſewed together that no water could get in, he might keep the Sea in the greateſt Storms with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger. The top of this Houſe, as of divers others alſo in this City, is a Reſervatory for Rain-water, which they have the more need of, becauſe they have little good water hereabouts.</p>
            <p>The faireſt Streets in the Town are <hi>Harlem-ſtreet,</hi> the <hi>Cingel, Princes Graft, Kaiſers Graft,</hi> and the New Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the Iſland towards <hi>Gottenburg.</hi> And if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to build with Freeſtone, they will ſtill ſurpaſs theſe, which, I'le aſſure you, are in no ſmall meaſure beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p>I ſaw a Globe to be ſold, made by <hi>Vingbomes,</hi> between ſix and ſeven foot Diameter, valued at Sixteen thouſand Guldens: The Meridian alone, being of braſs, coſt a thouſand Guldens. The Globe is made of Copper-plates excellently well painted, with all the new Diſcoveries in it, as that of <hi>Anthony Van Dimons</hi> Land, found out 1642. in 42 degrees of Southern Latitude, and 170 of Longitude, thoſe towards the Northweſt of <hi>Japan,</hi> and thoſe places both about <hi>N. Z.</hi> and alſo in the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Sea beyond the Streights of <hi>Voygats, New-Holland, Weſt-Frieſland, Cape d'Hyver, &amp;c.</hi> but I have ſince met with a Book, which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57700:10"/> doth ſomewhat contradict this; entituled <hi>A Voyage into the Northern Countries by Monſieur</hi> Martiniere, who went in one of the three ſhips belonging to the Northern Company of <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> in the year 1653. and by that means had occaſion to converſe with the <hi>Norwegians, Iſlanders, Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers, Kilops, Borandians, Siberians, Zemblians,</hi> and <hi>Samojedes,</hi> who are Neighbours to the <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorſes,</hi> in his 46 Chapter he expreſſeth himſelf after this manner. There having fallen into my hands ſeveral Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphical Charts of ſundry eminent and much celebrated Authors, I am much amazed to ſee how they are miſtaken in the poſition of <hi>Zembla,</hi> which they place much nearer the North Pole than really it is; they divide it likewiſe by the Sea from <hi>Greenland,</hi> and place it far diſtant from it, when as indeed thoſe two Countries are Contiguous, the Coaſts of <hi>Greenland</hi> butting upon the Coaſts of <hi>Zem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bla,</hi> ſo as did not the great quantity of Snow, and the violence of the cold render thoſe Borders uninhabitable, the paſſage would be very eaſie by Land from <hi>Greenland</hi> to <hi>Zembla,</hi> and from <hi>Zembla</hi> paſſing the <hi>Pater-noſter</hi> Mountains to enter into <hi>Samojedia,</hi> from thence into <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> or <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> as one pleaſed: But of the truth of this we ſhall be further informed at the return of Captain <hi>Wood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was amazed likewiſe to ſee they had deſcribed the Streight called <hi>Voygat,</hi> not above ten French Leagues in length, whereas it contains above five and thirty Dutch Leagues, which is ſix times as much. Again, they would perſwade us that through that Streight our ſhips might paſs into the great <hi>Tartarian</hi> Ocean, which is a miſtake. And although they indeed do affirm that in the time of Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> a Dutch Veſſel paſſed that way into that Ocean, yet it is a manifeſt errour, that Streight being bounded, as I ſaid before, by the <hi>Pater-noſter</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:57700:11"/> Mountains, which are half a League high, and the tops of them covered with perpetual Snow, which never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves. And of this I can give a poſitive teſtimony, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been my ſelf in that Streight under thoſe Mountains in the Dog-days, which is the hotteſt time of the year.</p>
            <p>From the Steeple of the Old Church of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> I had a good proſpect of the Town, and the great number of ſhips lying upon one ſide of it, like a Wood; and all the Towns about it. The Roofs of the Houſes being ſharp, it is a moſt uneven Town to be looked upon downward, as it is a handſome one to be looked on up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and is not ſo divertiſing or pleaſing to the ſight, as ſome Towns in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> which have flatter Roofs, or elſe are covered with a fine black Slat or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doiſe. Upon this, and all other Towers of the Town, a Trumpet is ſounded at Midnight, and in other parts of the City at ſix a Clock night and morning. At eleven a clock, the time of going on to the <hi>Exchange,</hi> there is good Muſick at the <hi>Stadthuis,</hi> given by the Earl of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter.</hi> They make good Harmony alſo every hour in playing upon their Chimes and Bells in moſt Steeples. And there is a Muſick-houſe or Entertaining-houſe, where any one is admitted for a Stiver, hears moſt ſorts of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, ſeeth many good Water-works, and divers motions by Clock-work, Pictures, and other Divertiſements.</p>
            <p>During my ſtay at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> I had the opportunity of ſeeing divers Learned Men, and Perſons of Note. Dr. <hi>Ruiſh</hi> ſhewed us many Curioſities in Anatomy, as the <hi>Skeletons</hi> of young Children, and <hi>Faetus's</hi> of all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, neatly ſet together, and very white; the <hi>Lympha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick veſſels</hi> ſo preſerved, as to ſee the <hi>valves</hi> in them. A Liver excarnated, ſhowing the Minute veſſels, all ſhining and clear. The Muſcles of Children diſſected and kept
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57700:11"/> from corruption: entire Bodies preſerved; the face of one was very remarkable, without the leaſt ſpot or change of colour or alteration of the lineaments, from what might be expected immediately after death: he had then kept it two years, and hoped it would ſo continue. Dr. <hi>Swammerdam</hi> ſhewed us divers of his Experiments which he hath ſet down in his Treatiſe <hi>De Reſpiratione;</hi> and a very fair Collection of Inſects brought from ſeveral Countries; a <hi>Stagg-fly</hi> of a very great bigneſs; an <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Scolopendria,</hi> or <hi>Forty-foot;</hi> a fly called <hi>Ephemeron,</hi> and many other Curioſities. Old <hi>Glawber</hi> the Chymiſt ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us his Laboratory: And we received much civility from <hi>Blaſius</hi> the Phyſick Profeſſour who hath wrote a Comment upon <hi>Veſlingius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Jews live more handſomly and ſplendidly here, than in any other place: Their chief Synagogue is large, adorned with Lamps of Braſs and Silver. We happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be there at the Feaſt of their <hi>New-year;</hi> ſo that their blowing of Horns, ſhowting and ſinging was not omitted: Some of them underſtand divers Languages. I ſaw one <hi>Moſes di Pas,</hi> a Learned young Man, and <hi>Orobio</hi> a Phyſician of Note. And I was ſorry to ſee divers here to profeſs themſelves publickly Jews, who had lived at leaſt reputed Chriſtians, for a long time in other places: One who had been a <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Frier thirty years: and another who had been Profeſſour ſome years at <hi>Tholouze,</hi> and before that Phyſician to the King of <hi>Spain. Juda Leo</hi> a Jew, hath taken great pains in making a Model of the Temple of <hi>Solomon,</hi> of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Houſe, the Fort of the Temple, the Tabernacle, the Iſraelites encamping, and other Curioſities. I was preſent at the Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Child; which is performed by thruſting a Probe in between the <hi>Glans</hi> and <hi>Praeputium,</hi> and ſeparating it, or dilating the <hi>Praeputium,</hi> ſo as the inward Skin may be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57700:12"/> drawn forward as well as the outward; then by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Inſtrument joynted like a Carpenters Rule, or a Sector, the Skin is held faſt beyond the <hi>Glans,</hi> and with a broad Inciſion-knife, or Circumciſion-knife, the Foreskin is cut off cloſe to the Inſtrument; and what remains of Skin is immediately put back, the blood ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with Powders, and a Plaiſter applyed; the Relations and Acquaintance ſinging all the while, whereby the cries of the Infant are leſs heard.</p>
            <p>Leaving <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> I paſſed by a peculiar Burial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place of the Jews, who are not permitted to interr their dead within the Walls, by <hi>Overskerk, Bamburg,</hi> and in ſix or ſeven hours arrived at <hi>Utretcht,</hi> in a Boat drawn with Horſes through artificial Cuts of Water, which is the way of Travelling in <hi>Holland, Utretcht,</hi> and divers other Provinces of the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Utretcht</hi> is an ancient, large, handſome City, and chief of the Province of the ſame name, called formerly <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nina,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Ultrajectum.</hi> Long famous for its Epiſcopal See founded by <hi>Dagobert</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> who endowed it richly with Lands and Poſſeſſions: <hi>Willebald,</hi> or <hi>Willebrode</hi> an Engliſhman, was their firſt Biſhop, who converted theſe Countries unto Chriſtianity; and the following Biſhops grew ſo powerful, that they were able to bring many thouſand men into the field, and to wage great Wars againſt the Counts of <hi>Holland:</hi> Their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion alſo continued for above Nine hundred years. It is now an Univerſity, founded by the States in the Year 1636. I ſhall not trouble you with the Names of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors; the Learned Mr. <hi>Ray,</hi> whom I had the honour to meet in divers places abroad, having already cauſed to be printed the <hi>Series Lectionum</hi> of this and many other Univerſities in the <hi>Low-Countries, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> in his <hi>Obſervations Topographical, Moral. Phyſiological,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:57700:12"/> ſet forth 1673. The great Church hath a very high Tower, or three Steeples one above another: From the higheſt of which I had not only a good ſight of the Town it ſelf, which lay under mine Eye like a Platform, but of many others alſo; <hi>Utretcht</hi> being in a plain flat Country, and ſo well ſeated, and encompaſſed with ſo populous a Country, that in a days Journey a man may go from hence to any one of fifty walled Towns and Cities. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church here is an ancient Building; the Pillar in the middle of it, whoſe Foundation could not be laid but upon Bulls-hides, is much taken notice of: It was built 1099. and hath the Picture of a Bull upon it with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription;</p>

            <p>There is an old Library belonging to this Church, which containeth divers old Books and Manuſcripts. A large Bible in ſix Volumes, painted and gilded after a very ancient manner: Two Idols taken (in time of war) long ſince in <hi>Germany,</hi> and given to this place by the Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, are worth the ſeeing, not ſo much for their neatneſs, as their Antiquity and odd ſhape: As alſo a Horn made out of a Tooth, ſaid to be given at the ſame time. There are alſo three <hi>Unicorns</hi> Horns, little differing in length; the longeſt being five foot and an half: I drank out of one of them, the end being tipp'd with Silver, and made hollow to ſerve for a Cup. Theſe were of the <hi>Sea-Unicorn,</hi> or the Horn or long wreathed Tooth of ſome Sea-Animal much like it, taken in the Northern Seas; of which I have ſeen many, both in Publick Repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitories, and in Private Hands. Two ſuch as theſe, the one Ten foot long, were preſented not many years ſince
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57700:13"/> to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> being taken near to <hi>Nova Zem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bla;</hi> and I have ſeen ſome full fifteen foot long; ſome wreathed very thick, ſome not ſo much, and others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt plain: Some largeſt and thickeſt at the End near the head; others are largeſt at ſome diſtance from the Head: Some very ſharp at the end or point, and others blunt. My honoured Father Sir <hi>T. B.</hi> hath a very fair piece of one which was formerly among the Duke of <hi>Curlands</hi> Rarities, but after that he was taken Priſoner by <hi>Doug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> in the wars between <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> it came into a Merchants hands, of whom my Father had it, he hath alſo a piece of this ſort of <hi>Unicorns</hi> Horn burnt black, out of the Emperour of <hi>Ruſſia</hi>'s <hi>Repoſitorie,</hi> given him by Dr. <hi>Arthur Dee,</hi> who was Son to Dr. <hi>John Dee,</hi> and alſo Phyſician to the Emperour of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> when his Chambers were burned, in which he preſerved his Curioſities. I have ſeen a walking Staff, a Scepter, a Scabbard for a Sword, Boxes, and other Curioſities made out of this Horn, but was never ſo fortunate as from experience to confirm its Medical Efficacy againſt Poyſons, contagious Diſeaſes, or any other evident effect of it, although I have known it given ſeveral times, and in great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But of theſe <hi>Unicorns</hi> Horns no man ſure hath ſo great a Collection as the King of <hi>Denmark;</hi> and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had ſo many, that he was able to ſpare about an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of them, to build a Magnificent Throne out of <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicorns</hi> Horns.</p>
            <p>I had the honour to ſee divers Perſons of Note in this City; as <hi>D.

            <p>This Town is alſo beautified with a fair Piazza or Market-place, divers long Streets, and a <hi>Pall-mall</hi> with five rows of Trees on each ſide.

He that hath obſerved the eaſie accommodation for Travel there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, both by Land and Water, their excellent order and regular courſe in all things; the number of Learned men; the abundance of Varieties in all kinds; the induſtry, frugality, and wealth of the people; their numerous good Towns; their extraordinary neatneſs in their Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Houſes; their proper Laws and adminiſtration of Juſtice; and their incredible Number of Shipping and Boats, will think it an omiſſion to reſt in the ſight of other Countries without a view of this. A Country of little extent, and ſoon travelled over, but ſo repleniſhed with People, with good Cities, fair Towns and Villages, as not to be met with upon ſo little a compaſs of ground, except perhaps in <hi>China.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Utrecht,</hi> in two hours, I came to <hi>Friſwick,</hi> and paſſed over the River <hi>Leck</hi> to <hi>Viaenen,</hi> where there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle remarkable beſides the Houſe and Gardens of Count

               <hi>Brederode,</hi> one of the Ancient Nobility of <hi>Holland,</hi> or, according to common eſteem, of the moſt Noble Family of all; the Family of the <hi>Egmonds</hi> being formerly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Richeſt; the <hi>Waſſenaer</hi>'s the moſt ancient, and the <hi>Brederodes</hi> the Nobleſt. The Mount in this Garden ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth for the Rampart to the Town, and on a round <hi>Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark</hi> are divers ſmall braſs Guns planted.

            <p>The more remarkable becauſe it made good its Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the year 1672. when <hi>Louis</hi> the Fourteenth, King of <hi>France,</hi> came down with ſo powerful an Army into the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> that in that Summers Expedition he took thirty walled Towns and Cities, this Water-gate being the Limit to his Conqueſts this way, beyond which his Forces were not able to attempt any thing.</p>

The <hi>Avenues</hi> to it are by narrow Cauſies, made turning and winding, to be commanded in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by one or other of the ſix Sconces or Forts built at ſome diſtance without the Town for its greater Security. Beſides which, the Hollanders having ſome reaſon to be jealous of the Inhabitants, whoſe affections might incline them towards the neighbouring Princes, of whoſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion moſt of them are, they have built a Citadel within the Town, a Briel or pair of Spectacles to look more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately into their Affairs. It is a handſom regular Fort of five Baſtions, each Curtain is 84 ordinary paces long; the Faces of each Baſtion 63; and the Flank or Neck 24. There is a handſome Houſe of Stone for the Centry
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57700:15"/> at the point of each Baſtion, and the middle of each Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, every one of which coſt Seven hundred Guldens. Here is alſo a Field Canon of an extraordinary length, ſaid to be able to fling a Bullet almoſt as far as <hi>Bommel.</hi> The Piazza in this Town is Triangular.</p>
            <p>This City was made an Epiſcopal See, 1559. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral is Dedicated to St. <hi>John.</hi> In the Quire are paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Arms of many of the Knights of the <hi>Golden Fleece.</hi> And over the upper Stalls or Seats, an Inſcription in <hi>French,</hi> which contains the Hiſtory of the firſt Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Model of this Order, by the moſt High and mighty Prince <hi>Philip</hi> the Good, Duke of <hi>Burgundy, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> and <hi>Brabant:</hi> Beſides divers Statua's and Pillars.

            <p>From the <hi>Boſche</hi> we travelled through a plain Country, ſomewhat Sandy, to <hi>Breda</hi> upon the River <hi>Merck:</hi> A place very conſiderable, pleaſantly ſeated, and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortified. It hath formerly had more Outworks than at preſent: For they have taken away the Crown-works, and left only the Half-moons and Horn-works, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves or Contregards about the Half-moons. There is a large Ditch of Water round the Counterſcarp, and a ſmall Ravelin between each Baſtion, joyned to the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part within ſide of the Ditch. There is alſo a double Haye or Quickſet-hedge almoſt quite round the Town, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Paliſados. The <hi>Parapet</hi> is very thick, and ſtrengthned

            <p>Leaving <hi>Breda</hi> we ſoon came by Land to St. <hi>Gertruyden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> the laſt Town on the North of <hi>Brabant,</hi> where it joyneth to the Province of <hi>Holland,</hi> a ſmall place, but a good Town for fiſhing, lying upon a Hill near the great broad Water called <hi>de Waert,</hi> made by the falling of the <hi>Maes</hi> and many other Rivers into it. This Town is fortified and Garriſoned. The Church and Steeple have been Large and fair, and the ruines of the latter are obſervable, in regard that this Steeple was ſhot down by a Stratagem of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> while the Governour and chief of the Town were upon it, to obſerve a falſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm in the Prince's Camp, and ſo loſt themſelves and the Town.

               <hi>Middleburg</hi> is the chief Town in the Iſland <hi>Walachria,</hi> ſeated almoſt in the middle of it, being well built, large, rich, and Populous, it is the fourth Port for the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> trade: hath a large, broad Water within the Town, and a ſtreight cut through the Land to carry Veſſels out to Sea, the whole is very well Fortified, the Officers here are choſen by Strangers or Foreigners, the Churches are many and remarkable, the new Church is of an eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquare figure with a <hi>Cupola,</hi> the Tower of the old great Church very high, the <hi>Stadthuiſe</hi> with the old ſtatuas, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, the round <hi>Piazza,</hi> and many private buildings are Conſiderable, and the whole Country about it is fruitful; either divided into Gardens and Orchards, or Planted with <hi>Madder, Pompions,</hi> or Grain and Fruits. The <hi>Zealanders</hi> are generally addicted to the intereſt of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and great Lovers of his Perſon. I found them not a little delighted that the Prince had been
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57700:17"/> with them ſome days before, and was made <hi>Premier</hi> Noble, or chief of the States of <hi>Zealand;</hi> which was chiefly brought about, as I was informed, by <hi>Penſioner Hubert, Le Sage, Duvelaer</hi> and <hi>Vriebergen,</hi> formerly no great friends to the Prince, eſpecially <hi>Vriebergen,</hi> who was the moſt earneſt of any to bring him in, in deſpite to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> for General <hi>Worts</hi> his ſake, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet over the <hi>Zealand</hi> forces by thoſe of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> lately affronted <hi>Vriebergens</hi> Son who was a Colonel, at the head of his Regiment. I was entertained at <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> very courteouſly by Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> the Miniſter, who alſo ſent his Kinſman with me to <hi>Fluſſing. Fliſſinga</hi> or <hi>Vluſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</hi> hath Stone-Wals towards the Sea, and Mudworks towards the Land; a very good Port, and a ſtrong Town; the waves of the Sea waſhing its walls; it was one of the firſt Towns which the Low Country men took from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in the year 1572, and was made Cautionary to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> together with <hi>Rammakins</hi> and the <hi>Briel.</hi> 1585. The renowned Sr. <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt Governour of it, and ſurrendred by King <hi>James</hi> to the United ſtates. 1616. The Sea ſhoar here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts is not only faced with ruſhes, flaggs and reeds ſtaked down as high as the Tide uſually ariſeth, but it is alſo ſtrongly bound over with Oſiers and hurdles and great Poſts driven in to break the force of the Water, and ſecure the Piles which make the Harbour or Havens mouth. The Town-houſe is handſomely built, ſtanding in the <hi>Piazza,</hi> having three rowes of Pillars in the Front one above another; the Lower <hi>Dorick,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick,</hi> and the higheſt <hi>Corinthian;</hi> and on the top there is a Gallery or Balcony to Diſcover ſhips at Sea. This is the third Port for the Eaſt-<hi>India</hi> trade; <hi>Amſterdam</hi> and <hi>Rotterdam</hi> being the firſt and ſecond: here lay many great ſhips in the middle of the Town, and conſiderable
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57700:18"/> men of War, as the St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> and the Admiral of <hi>Zealand:</hi> we ſaw them alſo building of divers ſhips, and when the Prince was here, they Lanched one to diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe him, to which he gave the name of William <hi>Frederick,</hi> they alſo preſented him with a Golden Bottle; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Arms of the Town: the Prince Landed at <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muyden</hi> and went from thence to <hi>Tergoes,</hi> and thence to <hi>Breda;</hi> they reported his entertainment in <hi>Walcheren</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to fifty thouſand <hi>Guldens.</hi> The Women in this Iſland wear moſt of them red Cloth and ſtraw-Hats, if a Man dies a great bundle of Straw is layd at the Door, if a Boy, a little one, if a Woman, the ſtraw lies on the left ſide of the Door: when any Woman is brought to bed; they faſten a piece of Lawne to the ring and rapper of the Door; and make it up into a little baby or puppet finely pleated, and in ſuch manner, as to diſtinguiſh of what ſex the young Child is.</p>
            <p>Returning to <hi>Middleburg</hi> by Land I obſerved there was a row of Trees round the Town between the moat and rampart, where ordinarily there is only a breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke or a hedge, and embarked at <hi>Middleburg</hi> again, and paſſed down the River by the fort <hi>Rammakins,</hi> and ſo for the <hi>Schelde,</hi> Sayling up that noble River till we had paſſed the Fort <hi>Frederick Henrick</hi> and came to <hi>Lillo;</hi> where we ſtayd till the Veſſell was ſearched. Over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Lillo,</hi> lyeth another Fortification, called <hi>Lifgens hock;</hi> the Fort <hi>de la croix</hi> is the laſt that belongeth to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and lieth on the North ſide of the River; the Banks are cut nigh to it, and the Country drowned for its greater ſecurity. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Forts hereabouts to defend the Frontiers, are the <hi>Philip,</hi> the <hi>Pearl,</hi> and the <hi>Maria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The River <hi>Scaldis</hi> or <hi>Scheld</hi> mentioned by <hi>Caeſar</hi> is a gallant River, affording plenty of fiſh, and convenience
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57700:18"/> for Navigation and paſſage unto ſeveral noted places: It ariſeth in the Country of <hi>Vermandois,</hi> paſſing to <hi>Cambray, Valencienne,</hi> ſo to <hi>Tournay</hi> or <hi>Dornick, Oudenard, Gaunt, Rupelmond</hi> and <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and purſuing its courſe is afterwards divided into two ſtreams, whereof the Southern is called the <hi>Hont;</hi> the other runs by <hi>Bergen ap Zome,</hi> and ſo into the Sea between the Iſles of <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day morning we went on our Voyage ſtill up the <hi>Scaldis</hi> or <hi>Schelde,</hi> and arrived at <hi>Antwerp.</hi> Where I had the good fortune to ſee Mr. <hi>Hartop;</hi> one very well known in all thoſe parts and of high eſteem for his perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtrength and valour. A Gentleman alſo ſo courteous that he makes it his buſineſs to oblige ſtrangers; he ſhew'd me many curioſities in this City, carrying me with him in his Coach.</p>
            <p>The Walls of <hi>Antwerp</hi> are very large, faced with Brick and freeſtone, having divrs rows of Trees upon them, broad walks, and conveniences for the Coaches, to make their tour upon. The <hi>Baſtions</hi> are not ſo large as generally they build now a dayes, yet after the modern way. The Ditch is very broad and deep, the Country about it, all Gardens. The <hi>Cittadel</hi> is a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar fortification of five <hi>Baſtions,</hi> wherein lies alwayes a Garriſon of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Soldiers: upon every curtain there are two mounts or Cavaliers; and between them below, a row of building or lodgings for the Soldiers; the ears of the <hi>Baſtions</hi> are cut down, and <hi>Caſamates</hi> made, and Paliſados ſet round upon the <hi>Eſplanade;</hi> the Walls are lined with excellent Brick and ſtone, nor is there any where a more regular beautifull Fortification of five <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions</hi> that is finiſhed: it commands the City, the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and the Country: beſides this <hi>Cittadel</hi> there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fort within the Town near the <hi>Scheld,</hi> to command
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57700:19"/> the River, having eight Guns in it, called St. <hi>Laurence</hi> Fort.</p>
            <p>The Exchange is handſome, ſupported by 36 Pillars e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of a different carving, four ſtreets lead unto it, ſo that ſtanding in the middle we ſee through every one of them. The <hi>Meer</hi> or Largeſt ſtreet is conſiderable for the water running under it, and for the meeting of Coaches upon it every evening to make their tour through the ſtreets of the City, which are clean and beautiful; at one end of it ſtands a large Braſs Crucifix upon a Pedeſtall of Marble. The <hi>Jeſuites</hi> Church goeth far beyond any of that bigneſs that I have ſeen out of <hi>Italy.</hi> The Front is noble, with the Statua of <hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi> on the top, A great part of the inſide of the Roof was painted by <hi>Rubens,</hi> and ſome of it by <hi>Van Dyke:</hi> there be many Excellent peeces of flowers done by <hi>Segers</hi> a <hi>Ieſuite;</hi> the Carving and gilding of all the works is exquiſite: The Library of the Colledge is great, &amp; the Books diſpoſed handſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into four Chambers; the Founder hereof was <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fridus Houtappel,</hi> whoſe Monument, together with his Wife and Children are worth the ſeeing, in a Chappel on the South ſide of this Church. In the Church of the <hi>Carmelites</hi> is a large Silver Statua of our Lady, and models of Cityes in ſtone. <hi>Onſar Lieven Vrowen Kerck,</hi> or <hi>the Church of our bleſſed Lady</hi> is the greateſt in the City; and the Steeple one of the faireſt in the World, five hundred foot high: one of their feet is eleven of our inches; ſo as it is 459 of our feet. In this Church there is much Carving, and a great number of Pictures highly eſteemed, among which one piece is much taken notice of, drawn by <hi>Quintin,</hi> at firſt a Smith, who made the neat Iron work of the Well before the Weſt door; and afterwards to obtain his Miſtreſs, he proved a famous Painter; his head is ſet up in Stone at the entrance of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57700:19"/> the Church, with an inſcription and this verſe.</p>
            <q>Connubialis amor de Mulcibre fecit Apellem.</q>
            <p>I was at the famous Abby of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> pleaſantly ſeated upon the <hi>Scheld;</hi> where among other curioſities, I ſaw a glaſs, which repreſented the Pictures of our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> and the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> collected from the Putting together of divers other heads: One was repreſented from a Picture wherein were thirteen faces, and another from one of twelve; over the bleſſed Virgin was this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</p>
            <q>Diva nitet variis expreſſa Maria Figuris.</q>
            <p>The Counteſs of <hi>Brabants</hi> Tombe, who was drowned, and her <hi>Statua,</hi> as alſo the Monument of <hi>Ortelius,</hi> are here ſhewn. <hi>Macarius Simoneus</hi> was then Abbot, the Monks 63. Near unto the Wharf-gate is the Church of St. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgis</hi> an Engliſh Saint, who contributed much towards the converſion of theſe Countries.</p>
            <p>The Town-houſe is fair, the Houſe built for the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>country Merchants is very ſtately and large, but runneth now to ruine, in this I ſaw among other curioſities, divers ſtrange Muſical inſtruments, which at preſent are not underſtood, or at leaſt not made uſe of: The <hi>Heſſen</hi> houſe hath been alſo formerly conſiderable. The water which they make uſe of in Brewing, is brought by an Aqueduct from <hi>Herentall</hi> about thirty miles diſtant from hence; and is conveyed into the Town by a large Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, peculiarly walled in by it ſelf where it paſſeth the Ditch; in this City are many good Collections of Pict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures both Ancient and Modern, and excellent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature or Limning by <hi>Gonſol,</hi> one fine piece, which I
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57700:20"/> ſaw was peculiarly remarkable, it being the work of 35 ſeveral Maſters.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Antwerp,</hi> I paſſed to <hi>Bruſſels</hi> by water, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Boats five times, and going through divers locks, by reaſon that the Country is ſo much higher about <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and the water above two hundred foot lower at <hi>Antwerp.</hi> At <hi>Fontaine</hi> a league and half from <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> three Rivers croſs one another: one of them being carried over a bridg. The <hi>Piazza</hi> of <hi>Bruſſels</hi> is fair. and oblong in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure upon one of the longeſt ſides ſtands the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and over againſt it the Kings-houſe, where upon a Scaffold hanged with Velvet, Count, <hi>Fgmond</hi> and <hi>Horne</hi> were beheaded, the whole <hi>Piazza</hi> being hanged with Black Cloth. Upon the top of the Town-houſe, ſtand: St. <hi>Michael</hi> the Patron of the City in Braſs, Count <hi>Marſins</hi> houſe formerly belonging to the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> hath a fair Court, and overlooks a good part of the City, but a quarter of it is ruined by Lightning. The Thunder bolt or Stone which they affirm to have effected it, is bigger than two Mens heads, and hangs up upon the door at the entrance. The <hi>Ieſuites</hi> Church is handſome, and in it the fair white Tower is beautifully gilded at the top. The <hi>Carmelites</hi> Church hath a noble Altar, and near unto the Church is the <hi>Statua</hi> of a piſſing boy, which is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Conduit. The Armory was well furniſhed, as we were informed, before the Governours of the low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries ſold the Arms; and <hi>Caſſel Roderigo</hi> the Governour left it very bare. There remains the Armour of <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth, of Duke <hi>Albert,</hi> of the Prince of <hi>Parma, Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtus,</hi> and of the Duke <hi>d'Alva</hi> and of the Duke <hi>Alberts</hi> horſe who being ſhot ſaved his Maſter, and died the ſame day twelve month; Spears for the hunting the wild Boar, one with two Piſtols; The Armour of Cardinal <hi>Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi> and of an <hi>Indian</hi> King; A <hi>Poliſh</hi> musket which carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57700:20"/> ſix hundred paces; <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth's Sword for the making the Knights of the <hi>Golden Fleece,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth's Sword ſent to declare war; Good Bucklers for Defence, and ſome well wrought; eſpecially one with the Battel of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> and his Elephants; and Banners ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with <hi>Francis</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> at the Battel of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Somewhat like <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bouillons</hi> ſhooting the three Pigeons near the Tower of <hi>David,</hi> is the ſhot which <hi>Infanta Iſabella</hi> made, when with an Arrow ſhe killed a Bird, in memory whereof, a Bird pierced with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is ſet upon the top of a Tower in the Count, which is large; and if the New Buildings and Deſign were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, it would be very handſome. Before the Court ſtand five braſs Statues. The Park is pleaſant, with Trees ſet in order, and adorned with Grotto's, Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and Water-works, which come very near the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian;</hi> one piece ſomewhat imitating <hi>Fraſcati,</hi> in which all Muſical Inſtruments are imitated, and a perpetual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion attempted: and on the Front of the Buildings ſtand the <hi>Caeſars</hi> head. But the Eccho is moſt remarkable; which may perfectly be diſtinguiſhed to ten or twelve Replies. The greateſt Church is that of St. <hi>Gudula;</hi> in which is her Statua, the Devil ſtriving to blow out the Light of her Lanthorn. Two Chappels therein are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable; the one built by <hi>Leopoldus,</hi> very fair on the outſide: the other towards the North, hath been viſited by five Kings, in which is the Hoſt which bled being ſtabbed by the Jews. In the <hi>Dominican</hi> Church is the Monument of the Duke of <hi>Cleve</hi> and his Dutcheſs, in <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian</hi> braſs. But for a New Church that of the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gennes,</hi> or Pious Maids, is very conſiderable; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eight hundred of them in this City, who have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular place allotted to them, where they have built this
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57700:21"/> milk white Church. The Plague was much in this place at that time, three hundred Houſes being ſhut up, and a Garland placed on the doors, in the middle of which † was written IHS. I ſaw the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nunnery, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſiderable Buildings. And after I had refreſhed my ſelf at the Fiſh-Tavern, which is worth the ſeeing, eſpecially for two Rooms in it, furniſhed from top to bottom with very good Pictures, I returned to <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octob.</hi> 4. I travelled through an open Country, and lodged at <hi>Molin bruſlè.</hi> The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Souldiers met us upon the Road this day, ſome of them well mounted and armed, and begged of us, and were well ſatisfied with a ſmall Benevolence. The next day we entred the Country of <hi>Liege,</hi> and paſſed great Heaths, and on the Sixth, in the morning, arrived at <hi>Maeſtreicht.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Trajectum ad Moſam,</hi> or <hi>Maeſtreicht,</hi> is a ſtrong Town, ſeated upon the <hi>Maes,</hi> four Leagues below <hi>Liege.</hi> The Out-works are very conſiderable; the Wall is old. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the South-eaſt lyeth a Hill, which ariſeth gently, and overlooks part of the Town. Under this Hill is one of the nobleſt Quarries of Stone in the World. To ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Town from the diſadvantage it might receive from this Hill, there was formerly a Fort built upon it, but it hath been long ſince ſlighted; and they have made out an Horn-work within Musket-ſhot of it, and the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion anſwering to it is made very high, to cover the Town. On the other ſide of the River ſtandeth <hi>Wicke,</hi> very well fortified alſo, and rather ſtronger than <hi>Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreicht,</hi> into which they might retire if the Town ſhould be taken by Storm, it being united to <hi>Maeſtreicht</hi> by a handſome Bridge over the <hi>Maes,</hi> conſiſting of Nine Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. All about <hi>Wicke</hi> the Country is flat: there are
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57700:21"/> many Inhabitants in it, and a handſome Glaſs houſe.</p>
            <p>The private Houſes of <hi>Maeſtreicht</hi> are generally cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a black Slat, or Ardoiſe, otherwiſe not very beautiful. The Town houſe is fair, ſeated in one of the <hi>Piazza's,</hi> built of white Stone; it hath Nine large Windowes in a row on each ſide, and within is very well painted by <hi>Theodorus van der Schuer,</hi> who was Painter to the Queen of <hi>Sweden.</hi> In another <hi>Piaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> is a Fountain, rows of Trees, and the great Church. This Town was beſieged and taken from the King of <hi>Spain</hi> by the Confederate States, in the year 1632.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>October</hi> the Seventh I dined at <hi>Gallop,</hi> a ſmall place, and came that night to <hi>Aken, Aix la Chapelle,</hi> or <hi>Aquiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grane,</hi> an ancient noble City, the Inhabitants Courteous, and much frequented by reaſon of its hot Baths, of which I ſhall ſpeak more particularly in my Journey from <hi>Colen</hi> to <hi>London.</hi> Leaving <hi>Aken</hi> I travelled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Juliers</hi> or <hi>Gulick,</hi> but it being late before we arrived, the Gates were ſhut up, ſo as we went on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the Walls, leaving it on our right hand. Near unto <hi>Gulick</hi> runneth a ſhallow ſwift River, called the <hi>Roer.</hi> At the Mouth of it, where it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth into the <hi>Maes,</hi> is ſeated a conſiderable Town, called <hi>Roermonde,</hi> through which I paſſed in the year 1673. when Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkins</hi> and Sir <hi>Joſeph Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamſon</hi> were ſent Plenipotentiaries to <hi>Cologne,</hi> in our Journey from <hi>Antwerp</hi> to that City. We then paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Country of <hi>Brabant,</hi> by the way of <hi>Thornhaut, Weert, Roermonde,</hi> and the next Night paſſing by <hi>Erke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens,</hi> lodged at <hi>Caſtro,</hi> or <hi>Caſter,</hi> in <hi>Gulickland,</hi> where there are ſtill the remains of an old Caſtle, formerly built for the Defence of that part of the Country. <hi>Roermonde</hi> is ſeated upon a riſing Hill, near the River
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57700:22"/> 
               <hi>Roer,</hi> hath a Colledge of Jeſuits in it, a handſome <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azza,</hi> and an old Abby with divers Monuments very ancient, founded by <hi>Gerard</hi> Earl of <hi>Guelderland.</hi> From this Town their Excellencies were ſaluted with the Guns from their Walls, charged with Bullets. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> in moſt places ſtriving to expreſs the higheſt of their reſpects.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Gulick</hi> I travelled to <hi>Cologne,</hi> where I arrived <hi>October</hi> the <hi>10th,</hi> 1668.</p>

Their Bodies, as the account goeth, were firſt removed to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> by <hi>Helena</hi> the Mother of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> the Great; then to <hi>Milan</hi> by <hi>Euſtorfius</hi> Biſhop thereof; and they have now reſted at <hi>Colen</hi> for above five hundred years, being tranſlated from <hi>Milan</hi> hither by <hi>Rainoldus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Colen,</hi> in the year 1164. There are alſo divers other Monuments of Biſhops, and Noble Perſons in Braſs and Stone, and one in the ſhape of a Caſtle with ſix Towers. The Canons of this Church are all Noblemen; among whom the Duke of <hi>Newburg,</hi> who ordinarily reſides at <hi>Duſſeldorff,</hi> about twenty <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles below this City, upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> hath two Sons. In a Church dedicated to all the Apoſtles, they ſhew a Tomb, which being opened by Thieves, intending to plunder it, the woman buried in it aroſe up and went home, and lived with her Husband divers years after. In one of the Streets is a Tower, or rather one Tower upon another, which ſeems to be ancient, now made a Priſon. Upon another Ruine alſo in the Streets lies a Tombemade out of one Stone; of which ſort of Tombs there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in this City and other places; but the greateſt number of them I ever ſaw was at <hi>Arles</hi> in <hi>Provence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Senate Houſe is Noble, having a fair Tower upon
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57700:24"/> it, from whence there is a good proſpect over the City. Upon the Front of the Senate Houſe is a Man in <hi>Baſſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievo,</hi> fighting with a Lyon, who, as it was related to me, was formerly one of the Conſuls, who having had a conteſt with ſome Clergy-men about the Government of the City, on a ſuddain they cauſed a Lyon to be let in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him: upon which occaſion he behaved himſelf ſo well, as he delivered himſelf, and ſlew the Lyon.</p>
            <p>The Elector or Archbiſhop of <hi>Colen</hi> hath two Palaces in the City, but by agreement between him and the Town, he is not to ſtay here above three days together. Only this preſent Archbiſhop, upon the coming down of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Forces, and his loſs of <hi>Bonna,</hi> took Sanctuary here in the Convent of St. <hi>Pantaleon,</hi> where he continued a great while.</p>
            <p>The City is Imperial and Free, and yet it doth Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the Elector, much after this Form: <hi>We free Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of</hi> Colen <hi>promiſe to the Archbiſhop, to be faithful and favourable unto him as long as he preſerves us in Right and Honour, and in our ancient Priviledges, Us, our Wives, our Children, and our City of</hi> Colen. Moſt of the City are of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and the whole Town ſo full of Convents, Churches, Church-men and Reliques, that it is not undeſervedly ſtyled the <hi>Rome of Germany.</hi> The <hi>Lutherans</hi> have alſo a Church within the Walls, and the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> at <hi>Mulheim,</hi> half a League down the Stream on the other ſide of the <hi>Rhine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Over againſt <hi>Colen</hi> lieth <hi>Dútz,</hi> a ſmall Village, inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted chiefly by Jews. The Veſſels which come out of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> hither are long, round bellied, and of great burden. Near to the Wall of the Town, upon the Quay or Key, is a kind of Harbour made for them, into which they may be drawn, and eſcape the Injuries they would otherwiſe ſuffer by the Ice in Winter.</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:57700:24"/>
            <p>Beſides the rich Clergy, there are many wealthy Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens and Merchants here, and they maintain a Traffick and Correſpondence with divers Countries, eſpecially by the convenience of the <hi>Rhine.</hi> They ſpeak not the beſt <hi>High-dutch;</hi> but <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>French</hi> are underſtood by many: Divers Hoſts in Inns ſpeak <hi>Latin,</hi> and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants <hi>French;</hi> which proves a good help unto Travellers. It was made an Univerſity about the year 1388. Beſides the General Hoſpitals for young and old perſons, there are two for the Sick, and well accommodated. They have a <hi>Pharmacopaea Colonienſis,</hi> or a <hi>Diſpenſatory</hi> proper to the place, whereby <hi>Apothecaries</hi> compound their Medicines. I was acquainted with one of the beſt, Mr. <hi>Elburg,</hi> a knowing and obliging perſon, who was his Majeſties A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecary while he reſided at <hi>Colen,</hi> and whom my honoured Friend Sir <hi>Alexander Fraſer,</hi> his Majeſties chief Phyſician, made uſe of, who lived in great reputation in this City.</p>
            <p>Two hundred years ſince <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> left an high expreſſion concerning this place, <hi>Coloniâ quae de conjuge</hi> Claudii <hi>matre</hi> Neronis, Agrippina <hi>dicta eſt, &amp; trium Magorum oſſibus illuſtrata, nihil magnificentius, nihil orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, totâ</hi> Europâ <hi>reperias:</hi> which though, if ſtrictly conſtrued, will hardly be admitted by any who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held <hi>Paris, Naples, Venice,</hi> &amp;c. yet doth it declare the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of this City, even in former times.</p>
            <p>We left <hi>Colen</hi> about four a Clock in the Afternoon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn up the Stream with Horſes, they being made faſt by a very long Rope to the Maſt; we lodged in a ſmall Village, having had a good proſpect of <hi>Colen</hi> all this Evening from off the water. Near to this Place <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caeſar</hi> made his Bridge over the <hi>Rhine.</hi> The next day we came to <hi>Bon,</hi> the Seat of the preſent Archbiſhop and Elector of <hi>Colen, Maximilianus Henricus,</hi> Duke of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57700:25"/> 
               <hi>Bavaria,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Hildiſheim</hi> and <hi>Liege,</hi> and Arch-Chancellor of the Empire throughout <hi>Italy.</hi> This place was formerly called <hi>Bonna,</hi> or <hi>Caſtra Bonnenſia,</hi> the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering place, in the time of <hi>Tacitus</hi> of the ſixth Legion. It was not long ſince very well fortified by the order of the preſent Archbiſhop, and the direction of Colonel <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer,</hi> a blind man, having <hi>Cataracts</hi> in both his eyes. The Archbiſhops Palace is very Noble, and there is a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſeated a good way into the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to which they paſs thorow a Gallery. This Night we lodged at the foot of the higheſt of the ſeven Hills by the <hi>Rhine,</hi> which are ſeen at a great diſtance; and upon divers of them ſtand old ruined Caſtles. On the <hi>15th</hi> we paſſed by a pleaſant Iſland with a Convent in it: at <hi>Remagen</hi> is alſo a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent upon a Rock, fortified with round Towers. In the Evening we lodged near to a Caſtle, ruined four years before by the Electors of <hi>Triers</hi> and <hi>Colen,</hi> it belonging at that time to the Duke of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> On the <hi>16th</hi> early in the Morning we came to <hi>Andernach,</hi> where the plague was very much at that time, and they kept a great many of their ſick in Boats upon the <hi>Rhine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Andernach,</hi> of old <hi>Antenacum,</hi> was one of the <hi>Roman</hi> Fortreſſes. Upon this River, ſome think that <hi>Caligula</hi> was born, and that <hi>Valentinian</hi> was buried hereabouts. Near unto this place are alſo Mineral Springs, well fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented, and much made uſe of. The Town is encompaſſed with an old Wall; and the Gates were ſhut up by reaſon of the Plague: Notwithſtanding, there being divers Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in our company, ſeveral of the Towns-men ſent out diſhes of Meat to them, which we eat in the Field upon Trees which were laid along near the Town. This day the paſſage by water ſeeming tedious to us, Mr. <hi>Mulſtroth,</hi> a worthy <hi>German</hi> Gentleman, with whom I travelled as far as <hi>Spire,</hi> was willing we ſhould hire a Coach toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57700:25"/> which we did, and invited the Friers with whom we had breakfaſted, to go along with us in it to <hi>Coblentz.</hi> We paſſed through a very pleaſant Country, between rows of <hi>Walnut-trees,</hi> in ſight of two of the Elector of <hi>Triers</hi> Houſes, and near to a Houſe belonging to the Count <hi>de Wert.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We paſſed the <hi>Moſella</hi> over a hand ſome Stone-bridge of thirteen Arches, built by Archbiſhop <hi>Baldus,</hi> or <hi>Baldui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> in the year 1344. and coming into the Town, we went to the <hi>Dominican</hi> Convent, which is pleaſantly ſeated near the Banks of the River <hi>Moſella;</hi> but the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of the Convent, whom we had brought with us, was ſo obliging, that he would not part with us that night; and we were very civilly entertained by him in his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: He invited alſo ſome of the Convent to bear us company; and after a handſome Supper, with plenty of excellent <hi>Moſelle</hi> wine, we went to bed between two Feather-beds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coblentz,</hi> or <hi>Confluentia,</hi> is a Town of a Triangular Figure, ſeated at the meeting of two great Rivers, the <hi>Rhine</hi> and the <hi>Moſella,</hi> which make two ſides thereof, and the third is made by a Line drawn from one River to the other; which is now well fortified after the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Modern way. The Wall within theſe Works had many old high Towers; and formerly there was another ſtill nearer to the uniting of the Rivers, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly containing a leſs ſpace of ground. This Town is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Elector and Archbiſhop of <hi>Triers, Carolus Caſpar,</hi> of the Noble Family of the <hi>Leyen,</hi> Arch-Chancellour for the Empire in <hi>Gallia Belgica,</hi> and the Kingdom of <hi>Arles.</hi> It was given to the Church of <hi>Triers</hi> when <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doaldus</hi> was Archbiſhop above a thouſand years ſince, in the time of King <hi>Dagobert.</hi> The Situation is pleaſant and convenient, and lieth over againſt the Caſtle of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſtein,</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:57700:26"/> or <hi>Ehrenbreitſtein,</hi> that is, <hi>The Stone of far extended Honour;</hi> at the foot of which Caſtle, upon the ſhoar of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> under a great Rock, ſtands a very Noble Palace of the Electors, two large Wings and the Front with five Pavilions ſtanding towards the River, and from it a long Bridge of Boats over the <hi>Rhine</hi> to <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentz:</hi> when any great Veſſel paſſeth by, they let ſlip three Boats, whereby the paſſage lieth open, and make them faſt again afterwards. In the <hi>German</hi> wars the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> thruſt in a Garriſon into this Town; which was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards beaten out by the <hi>Rhinegrave</hi> for the King of <hi>Sweden;</hi> and the ſtrong Caſtle of <hi>Ethrenbrietſtein</hi> being put into the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> the Emperours For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſeized upon the Archbiſhop of <hi>Triers,</hi> who then was <hi>Philippus Chriſtophorus,</hi> and carried him away to <hi>Vienna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In places where the <hi>Rhine</hi> runneth through a low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and a fat Soyl, it waſheth away the Banks: to ſecure which, in divers places they have made great Works of Wood, and alſo to ſecure Veſſels from the danger of the Ice. And I remember, riding near the Banks of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Loire</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> I obſerved them in ſome places to be handſomly defended for a long way together with Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone.</p>
            <p>Near unto <hi>Coblentz,</hi> upon a Hill, is a Convent of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſians. October</hi> the <hi>17th</hi> we went up the <hi>Rhine</hi> to <hi>Bop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,</hi> a walled Town, upon the weſtern bank, where <hi>Van Trump</hi> was at that time: It is a very old Town, one of the <hi>Roman</hi> Fortreſſes againſt the <hi>Germans,</hi> called anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently <hi>Bodobriga;</hi> ſome would have it called <hi>Bopport</hi> from <hi>Beauport, Fair-haven,</hi> or <hi>Bonport,</hi> a good convenient place for Veſſels to retire into, or to ride in.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>18th</hi> we dined at St. <hi>Guer,</hi> a pleaſant Town belonging to the <hi>Landtgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> who hath a Caſtle
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57700:26"/> here. Coming on ſhoar we met with an odd cuſtome: for upon the Wall ſide there is faſtned a Collar of Braſs at preſent, but was formerly of Lead, and given by <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth; into this moſt Strangers that come put their Necks, at which time they ask them, <hi>Whether they will be ſprinkled with water, or drink wine?</hi> and if they chooſe the latter, they give an entertainment of wine to the Company. The Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> paſſing by this place, gave a great Silver Cup, out of which they now drink at this Ceremony. We lodged this night at <hi>Weſel,</hi> a Town ſituated between a high Hill and the River, belonging to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Triers.</hi> Here in the Market-place they ſhew us the print of St. <hi>Huberts</hi> Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes foot in a Free-ſtone.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>19th</hi> we came to <hi>Baccharach,</hi> or <hi>ad Bacchi aras,</hi> belonging to the Elector <hi>Palatine;</hi> a place famous for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Wines. We paſſed by an old Caſtle ſeated upon a Rock in the middle of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> being of an irregular figure, called <hi>Pfalts,</hi> where formerly the Prince <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> of the <hi>Rhine</hi> were born, the Princeſſes being ſent hither to be brought to Bed. We came this night to <hi>Dreickſhauſen;</hi> the next day we went by a dangerous Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, there being many Rocks under water, which cauſe the River to run very rapid and unequally. A little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove this we came to a round Tower, on a Rock in the <hi>Rhine,</hi> called the <hi>Mouſe-tower,</hi> built by <hi>Hatto</hi> Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> in the year 900. who, as the Story goeth, in a time of great Scarcity, pretending to relieve the poor who wanted bread, invited them together into a Barn, where he burnt them all, ſaying, <hi>They were like the Rats and Mice which would devour the Corn.</hi> After which he was ſo perſecuted with Rats and Mice, that to avoid them he cauſed this Tower to be built in the middle of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> which did not avail him, for they followed him
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57700:27"/> thither alſo, and at laſt devoured him. A little above this lieth <hi>Bing</hi> upon the Weſtern ſhoar; a conſiderable Town, belonging to the Elector of <hi>Mentz:</hi> here our Boat ſtayed to pay Cuſtome, as it had done alſo at <hi>Bonna, Liutz, Hammerſtein, Andernach, Coblentz, Lodeſheim, Bopport,</hi> St. <hi>Gower, Cub,</hi> and <hi>Baccharach.</hi> For the trade of the <hi>Rhine</hi> being great, Princes and Lords, who have Towns upon it, make uſe of that advantage, which, though it abateth the gains of the Merchant, brings conſiderable profit to themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bing,</hi> or <hi>Bingium,</hi> was an old <hi>Roman</hi> Fortreſs upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> where the River <hi>Navus</hi> or <hi>Naw</hi> entreth into it; over which latter there is a handſome Stone-bridge: In this Town were many of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s Army ſick and wounded, who three weeks before had main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a fight againſt the Forces of the Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> near this place. From <hi>Bing</hi> we continued our Journey to <hi>Mentz:</hi> at <hi>Rudeſheim</hi> in <hi>Rhinegaw,</hi> a place noted for good Wine, they ſhewed us a Boy, whoſe hair was thick and woolly, like to the <hi>African-</hi>Moors, but of a fine white colour, which being ſomewhat an odd ſight, I took away ſome of his hair with me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mentz, Moguntia, Moguntiacum,</hi> and by the <hi>French Mayence,</hi> is ſeated over againſt the Confluence of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Main,</hi> with the <hi>Rhine,</hi> or rather a little below it; in a fertile Country, abounding in all Proviſions and good Wine; it lieth at length, and is moſt extended towards the River; and that part excelleth the other towards the Land, which is not ſo populous or well-built: It is a ſtrong place, and well guarded; it hath many Churches and Monaſteries, and ſome fair Buildings, eſpecially thoſe of publick concern, as the Palace of the Elector, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: But the narrowneſs of the Streets, and many old Houſes, take away much from the beauty of the City.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57700:27"/> It is an Univerſity, begun about the year 1486. or as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will have it 1461. This place alſo challengeth the Invention of Printing, or at leaſt the firſt promotion or perfection thereof: And the Territory about it is famous for the deſtruction of the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions under <hi>Varus,</hi> by the <hi>Germans. Guſtaphus Adolphus,</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> was wonderfully pleaſed upon the taking of this City, 1631. entring into it in State upon the <hi>14th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Birth-day, which began the <hi>38th</hi> year of his life, and kept his Court and <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> here; where at one time there were with him ſix chief Princes of the Empire, twelve Ambaſſadours of Kings, States, Electors, and Princes; beſides Dukes and Lords, and the Martial men of his own Army. At the taking of the Town, they found great ſtore of Ordnance and Powder; and the City re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed it ſelf from Pillage by giving the King a Ranſome of Eighty thouſand <hi>Dollars;</hi> and the Clergy and Jews gave Two and twenty thouſand more, of which the Jews paid Eighteen thouſand; Archbiſhop <hi>Wambold</hi> ſaving himſelf upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and retiring to <hi>Colen.</hi> The King cauſed alſo two great Bridges to be made, one over the <hi>Main,</hi> founded upon fifteen great flat bottom'd Boats, the reſt being built upon great Piles of Wood: Another over the <hi>Rhine</hi> ſupported by ſixty one great flat Boats, each lying the diſtance of an Arch from one another; and many Families of people living ſometimes in the Boats un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Bridge. The Bridge over the <hi>Main</hi> is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; but that over the <hi>Rhine</hi> is ſtill continued: Upon which I ſaw the preſent Elector paſſing in his Coach; a Perſon of great Gravity, of a middle Stature, having long grey Hair, and was very Princely attended; his Name <hi>Joannes Philippus</hi> of the Noble Family of <hi>Schoen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> Elector and Archbiſhop of <hi>Mentz</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wurtz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> and Biſhop of <hi>Worms,</hi> Arch-Chancellour of the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57700:28"/> Empire for all <hi>Germany;</hi> the firſt of the <hi>Electoral Colledge;</hi> in all publick Conventions he ſits at the right hand of the Emperour, and is a Succeſſour of the famous <hi>Boniface,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, Biſhop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> who ſo much promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Chriſtian <hi>Religion</hi> in theſe parts. But though his Dignity and Place excelleth the two other Eccleſiaſtical Electors of <hi>Colen</hi> and <hi>Triers,</hi> yet his Territories come ſhort; and they lye not together, but ſcatteringly with thoſe of the <hi>Palatinate, Spier, Franckfort,</hi> and divers places in <hi>Franconia.</hi> But of late he hath much encreaſed his Power, by ſeizing the great City of <hi>Erfurdt</hi> in <hi>Turingia,</hi> which he hath ſince much beautified and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a Citadel built upon St. <hi>Peters hill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Mentz</hi> I paſſed by water up the River <hi>Main,</hi> to <hi>Franckfort,</hi> a free City of the Empire, called <hi>Trajectum Franconum,</hi> a Paſſage or Ford of the <hi>Franks,</hi> as ſerving them for a Retreat, when they entred or returned from <hi>Gaul;</hi> at preſent <hi>Franckford</hi> upon the <hi>Main,</hi> to differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it from <hi>Franckford</hi> upon the River <hi>Oder,</hi> which is an Univerſity: It is a large Town, divided into two parts by the River; the leſſer called <hi>Saxonhauſen,</hi> or <hi>Saxon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes,</hi> united to the other by a Stone-bridge over the <hi>Main,</hi> of twelve or thirteen Arches. It is a place of good Trade, and well ſeated for it, as having the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the River <hi>Main,</hi> which paſſeth by <hi>Bamberg, Schweinfurt, Wurtzburg, Guemund,</hi> or <hi>Gaudia mundi;</hi> and alſo the <hi>Tauber,</hi> and other Rivers running into it, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth conveniency for Commerce with the remoter parts of <hi>Franconia;</hi> and the <hi>Main</hi> running into the <hi>Rhine,</hi> makes a large communication both up and down that Stream.</p>
            <p>But this place is moſt remarkable for the Election of the Emperour, which, by the Laws of the <hi>Golden Bull,</hi> ſhould be in this City, as alſo for two great Marts or
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57700:28"/> Fairs kept in <hi>March</hi> and <hi>September;</hi> at which times there is an extraordinary concourſe of people from remote parts, in order to buying and ſelling of ſeveral Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, eſpecially for Books, as well printed here as in other parts, whereof they afford two Catalogues every year, and have no ſmall dealings that way, by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the <hi>Germans, Hollanders, Italians, French,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh:</hi> although at other times their trading in Books ſeems not great; for when I was there out of the time of the Mart, the <hi>Stationers</hi> Shops being ſhut up, made but a dull ſhow. Here are alſo a great number of good Horſes bought and ſold: and on the North-ſide of the City there is a ſpacious place for a Horſe-Fair. The City is ſtrong and well fortified; and moſt part of the Town are <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans.</hi> In the <hi>German</hi> wars, the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> having taken <hi>Hanaw,</hi> ſent a Meſſenger to <hi>Franckfort</hi> to know whether the City would peaceably and ſpeedily ſet open their Gates unto him, and accept fairly of a Garriſon, or ſtand to the hazard of a Siege: And although they were unwilling to yield, yet for fear of the worſt, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, That the King ſhould have free paſſage for his Army through the City; and that for the better aſſurance of it, ſix hundred of his men ſhould be received for a Garriſon into <hi>Saxonhauſen;</hi> and alſo that the Magiſtrates and People ſhould take an Oath unto his Majeſty. So that upon the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> 1631. the King's Army paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through <hi>Saxonhauſen</hi> over the Bridge, quite through the Town. Colonel <hi>Vitzthumb</hi> was left Governour in <hi>Saxonhauſen;</hi> and the King himſelf rode bare-headed through the Streets: and by his obliging behaviour did generally win the affections of the beholders; and three days after returned thither again with the <hi>Landtgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſen-Caſſell,</hi> and the <hi>Landtgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſen-Darmſtadt,</hi> where they met the Seventeen Earls of the <hi>Wetteraw,</hi> or
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57700:29"/> 
               <hi>Veteravia,</hi> and were feaſted in the ſame room where the Emperours at their Coronation uſe to be entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Saxonhauſen</hi> there is a Houſe anciently belonging unto the Knights of the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Order, which hath the priviledge of a Sanctuary for Man-ſlayers and Bankrupts; but it is a ſecurity but for fourteen days. Upon this ſide there is the largeſt portion of Land belonging to <hi>Franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;</hi> on the other ſide very little.</p>
            <p>This being a trading place, it is no wonder that there are ſo many Jews in it; for a diſtinction they wear great Ruffs, their Sons Bonnets, and their Wives a peculiar dreſs of their Head.</p>
            <p>The Collegiate Church of St. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Emperours have been crowned, is large, hath a high Steeple, and is built of a red ſtone. There are divers handſome Fountains in the Town, and good Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; in one of the beſt of which liveth Monſieur <hi>Pierre Neufville,</hi> a great Merchant, and a civil worthy perſon, well known in moſt places of Commerce; who obliged me with Letters to <hi>Venice,</hi> and other places.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Franckfort</hi> I continued my Journey through the <hi>Bergſtraes,</hi> paſſing by <hi>Darmſtadt,</hi> which belongs to one of the Brothers of the Houſe of <hi>Heſſen,</hi> commonly known by the name of the <hi>Landtgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſen Darmſtadt;</hi> and afterwards through a fruitful plain Country, in the ſight of Hills, and ſometimes near them: the whole Country planted with Wallnut-trees, Vines, Corn, and in ſome places with Tobacco; till I arrived at <hi>Heidelberg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In coming into this Town we paſſed over the River <hi>Neccar, Nicer,</hi> or <hi>Necarus,</hi> upon a Bridge covered over from one end to another, with a large Roof of Wood: in the ſame manner is the long Bridge covered at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the City of <hi>Aleſſandria della paglia</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="53" facs="tcp:57700:29"/>
            <p>The River <hi>Neccar</hi> ariſeth near the <hi>Sylva Martiana,</hi> now <hi>Swartzwald,</hi> or <hi>Black Foreſt,</hi> and paſſing through the Territories of the Duke of <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> runneth into the <hi>Rhine</hi> at <hi>Manheim:</hi> This, though none of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, yet is a conſiderable River of <hi>Germany;</hi> and hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers good Towns upon it and near it, as <hi>Sultz, Tubingen, Wirtingen, Eſſingen, Stutgard, Canſtat, Lauffen, Hallbrun, Heidelberg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There being wars at that time when I was in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, between the Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain:</hi> The Elector reſided for the moſt part at <hi>Franken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> to be near his Forces.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Heidelberg</hi> is ſeated on the South-ſide of the River <hi>Neccar,</hi> between it and a ridge of high Hills, ſo as it cannot well admit of a modern Fortification, or hope to be extraordinary ſtrong, as being over-looked by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Mountains: It lieth moſt at length from Eaſt to Weſt: It hath been an Univerſity ſince the year 1346. at which time it was begun by <hi>Rupertus,</hi> Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> and at preſent is much frequented. In the great Church was kept the famous Library, which, after that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> had taken this Town 1620. was carried to <hi>Rome,</hi> and added to the <hi>Vatican,</hi> where I ſaw it in the year 1664. being placed upon one ſide of a very long Gallery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the <hi>Vatican</hi> Library; and the Duke of <hi>Urbin</hi>'s Library placed on the otherſide, over-againſt it: both which made a notable addition to the Papal Library. In this Church and the Church alſo of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> are divers Monuments of Princes of the <hi>Palatine</hi> Family, and of Learned and Famous Men. The <hi>French</hi> have a Church here, and the preſent Elector is of the Order of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and his Son a Mareſchal of <hi>France:</hi> and good <hi>French</hi> and <hi>High-dutch</hi> are both generally ſpoken here. The <hi>Lutherans</hi> have alſo a Church in this Town, by the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57700:30"/> favour of the preſent Elector; although he himſelf be a <hi>Calviniſt:</hi> and to expreſs his generous kindneſs the higher in this point, the firſt Stone was laid by himſelf and his Son; and it is called the <hi>Church of Providence,</hi> according to the Elector's Motto, <hi>Dominus Providebit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the Town-houſe is a Clock with divers Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and when the Clock ſtrikes, the figure of an Old man pulls off his hat, a Cock crows, and ſhakes his wings, Souldiers fight with one another, and the like. The Prince's Stables for above a hundred Horſes are ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the River very conveniently, but were fairer formerly, above half thereof having been ruined by the Imperialiſts; as alſo divers of the Statues on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the Caſtle, which is ſeated high above the Town.</p>
            <p>The preſent Elector is <hi>Carolus Ludovicus,</hi> Son to the King of <hi>Bohemia, Frederick</hi> the Fifth; he was born in the year 1617. and paſſed his Youth an Exile from his Fathers Kingdom and Electorate: and at the pacification at <hi>Prague</hi> 1635. he was excluded from any reſtitution to be made to him. But at length, in the Treaty of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> 1648. he was reſtored to the lower <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and 1652. returned to the poſſeſſion of his Fortunes: a highly accompliſhed Prince, much honoured and beloved by his Subjects. In the year 1650. he married <hi>Charlotta,</hi> Daughter to <hi>William</hi> the Fifth, <hi>Landgrave,</hi> and to the famous <hi>Amelia Elizabeth, Landgraveſs</hi> of <hi>Haſſia;</hi> by whom he had the <hi>Chur</hi> Prince, or Electoral Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> and a Daughter, the Princeſs <hi>Charlotta Elizabetha;</hi> but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome diſcontent the Princeſs Electreſs ſince returned to her own Friends and Country. This Elector is alſo Knight of the moſt Noble Order of the Garter, Great Treaſurer of the Empire, and together with the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> Vicar of the Empire.</p>
            <pb n="55" facs="tcp:57700:30"/>
            <p>In his Palace or Caſtle at <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> are divers things remarkable; a very great Tower to be equalled by very few; within which is a Theatre for Comedies. This was formerly called <hi>Trutzkaiſar,</hi> or the Tower that bad Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or threatned the Emperor; but ſince the Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Elector, there are ſome Works drawn about it in the figure of a Star, and the old diſobliging Name is by Proclamation forbidden to be continued, and it is at preſent called the <hi>Sternſchanz,</hi> or the <hi>Star-fort.</hi> By it is a handſome Garden; in the Ditch whereof there was then kept a great Bear, and a very large Wolf. The Grotto's and Water-works are very handſome: they were alſo making divers others, having the advantage of the ſide of the Hill to bring down the water, and to make Grots and Caves in the Rock. Amongſt other Fountains, that of the Lions head with a Frog in his Ear, is taken notice of. The Cellars are very large and cool, filled with Veſſels of no ordinary ſize; yet inconſiderable, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the great Tun kept in a great Building joyning to the Cellars; it was built by this preſent Elector's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, 1664. and goeth far beyond any made before: It contains 204 Faiders and odd meaſure, or about two hundred Tuns: inſtead of Hoops it is built with large knee Timber, like the ribs of a Ship, which are painted and carved, and have divers Inſcriptions upon them, and ſupported by carved Pediſtals. Upon one ſide of it is a handſome Staircaſe to aſcend to the top of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel; upon the top of which is a Gallery ſet round with Balliſters, three and forty ſteps high from the ground.</p>
            <p>About an <hi>Engliſh</hi> mile from <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> between the Hills, is a ſolitary place, where three large Streams or Springs guſh out of the Mountain, and preſently fill five Ponds, have three handſome Caſcates or Falls, and after run into the Plain, and are ſtrong enough in a
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57700:31"/> ſmall ſpace to turn four Mills; this is called <hi>Wolfsbrun,</hi> or the <hi>Wolfs Fountain,</hi> from a Princeſs who formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into a Cave in this deſart place, and was here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by a <hi>Wolf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While I was at <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> two <hi>Engliſh</hi> men came kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to me, Mr. <hi>Villers,</hi> and <hi>Timothy Middleton,</hi> belonging to <hi>Lobensfeldt Cloiſter,</hi> a Convent formerly of the Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its, but ſince let out to about an hundred <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who left their Country 1661. came up the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and by the permiſſion of the Elector, ſetled themſelves a few miles from hence, living altogether, men, women, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in one Houſe; and having a community of many things: They are of a peculiar Religion, calling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Chriſtian Jews; and one Mr. <hi>Poole,</hi> formerly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at <hi>Norwich,</hi> is their Head. They cut not their Beards, and obſerve many other Ceremonies and Duties, which they either think themſelves obliged to from ſome Expreſſions in the Old Teſtament, or from ſome New Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of their Leaders.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Heidelberg</hi> I made an excurſion, and had a ſight of <hi>Spire,</hi> ſeated in a Plain, on the Weſt-ſide of the <hi>Rhine;</hi> a place of Antiquity, conceived to be <hi>Urbs Nemetum</hi> of old; a large place and populous. The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> in the <hi>German</hi> wars demoliſhed the Works about it, not willing to ſpare ſo great a number of his Souldiers as was required to Garriſon it, and make it good. It is an Epiſcopal See under the Archbiſhop of <hi>Mentz:</hi> there are many fair Houſes in it, divers Churches, and a fair Cathedral, with four large Towers. The <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts</hi> preach in it at ſeveral hours. It is the more populous, and filled with people of good quality, by reaſon of the concourſe of perſons from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> for the deciſion of Law Suits: For here the Imperial Chamber is held, and many differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57700:31"/> which ariſe in the Empire are determined, and the Electors and other Princes, in ſome tryals at Law, may be called hither. It is a ſettled Court, which <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> the Firſt, for the better eaſe of all perſons, placed firſt at <hi>Worms,</hi> and not long after it was fixed at <hi>Spire,</hi> from whence it cannot be now removed, but by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all the Eſtates. Things Cognoſcible in this Court are determined by an Imperial Judge, and ſealed with the Emperours Arms, ſo that there lieth no appeal unto the Emperour.</p>
            <p>Another day I went to <hi>Manheim,</hi> formerly a Village, ſeated at the Confluence of the <hi>Rhine</hi> and <hi>Neccar;</hi> but walled about by the Elector <hi>Frederick</hi> the Fourth, and ſince is much encreaſed; all the Streets being large and uniform, and a Noble Citadel built; within which, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt the Gate, the Elector deſigns a Palace, the Model of which I ſaw: and at preſent, on the right hand, there are three Pavilions of Lodgings: in one of which lodgeth the Elector <hi>Palatine;</hi> in another the Prince his Son; and in the third the Princeſs his Daughter: behind theſe there is a handſome Garden and Lodgings for <hi>Degen Felderen,</hi> the <hi>Churfurſts</hi> Miſtreſs. Here are ſome good Pictures, as a Head of <hi>Hans Holben,</hi> and a Landskip with the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Union of the <hi>Swiſſers.</hi> The Bridge over the Moat of the Citadel into the Town, is alſo remarkable, as having ſix Draw-bridges upon it, three great ones, and three ſmall ones on the ſide. There are Paliſado's all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the bottom, in the middle of the Ditch, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out upon the <hi>Eſplanade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Heidelberg</hi> I travelled to <hi>Nurnberg</hi> in the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Captain <hi>Wagenſeyl,</hi> who had been in the <hi>Poliſh</hi> and <hi>Hungarian</hi> wars, and was employed a little before in blowing up the Caſtle of <hi>Launſteyn,</hi> belonging to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector <hi>Palatine,</hi> to prevent its ſurpriſal by the Duke of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57700:32"/> 
               <hi>Lorrain.</hi> He was then employed to raiſe a Company at <hi>Nurnberg,</hi> for the Service of the Elector <hi>Palatine.</hi> I had a good advantage in my Journey by his Company; for he travelled with Authority, and was a generous, knowing, and courteous perſon.</p>
            <p>The firſt day we travelled near to the <hi>Neccar,</hi> in ſtony and rocky way; and it being dark before we came to <hi>Moſpach,</hi> the Peaſants conducted us from Village to Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage with bundles of lighted Straw.</p>
            <p>The next day we came to <hi>Poxberg,</hi> where there is an old Caſtle, and in the afternoon reached <hi>Morkenthal,</hi> or <hi>Mergetheim,</hi> the Seat of the Grand Maſter of the <hi>Herrhn Deutchern,</hi> or the <hi>Teutonick Order.</hi> The Town is well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built, hath a fair <hi>Piazza,</hi> with a large Fountain in it, and a Statue of one of the Grand Maſters, with a long <hi>Corridore</hi> from his Palace. This Order hath been of great Fame, and hath had large Poſſeſſions, as may be ſeen in the exact Account of the <hi>Teutonick Knights</hi> of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> made out from the beſt Authors, by my worthy honoured Friend Mr. <hi>Aſhmole,</hi> in his Noble Deſcription of the Order of the Garter; and as <hi>Lewis du May,</hi> Counſellor unto the Duke of <hi>Wirtenberg,</hi> hath ſet it down. <hi>For the Knights Templars and of St.</hi> John, <hi>having fought proſperouſly againſt the Infidels, raiſed an Emulation in ſome</hi> German <hi>Gentlemen, who waited upon the Emperour</hi> Frederick <hi>the Firſt, in his Expedition to the</hi> Holy Land, <hi>to take the</hi> Croiſado. <hi>And becauſe they were inſtalled in the Church and Hoſpital of St.</hi> Mary <hi>at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>they were called</hi> Marianites. <hi>Their Order differed nothing from thoſe above-mentioned, but in the form and colour of their Croſs, and was approved by Pope</hi> Celeſtin <hi>the Third. Afterwards when</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by</hi> Saladin, <hi>thoſe Knights betook themſelves to</hi> Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mais, <hi>from whence the Emperour</hi> Frederick <hi>the Second, ſent them back into</hi> Germany, <hi>and employed them againſt the</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:57700:32"/> Pruſſians <hi>and</hi> Livonians, <hi>who at that time were ſtill Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans. But by the Valour and Piety of thoſe Knights, their Souls were brought into ſubjection to Chriſt, and their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to the Order which began that war in the year 1220. a little while after theſe Knights found themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of a Country of very large Extent, which obeyed the Order, till the year 1525. at which time</hi> Sigiſmond, <hi>King of</hi> Poland, <hi>gave the inveſtiture of</hi> Pruſſia <hi>unto</hi> Albert <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs of</hi> Brandenburg. <hi>In the year 1563. the Great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter became Secular again, and took a part of the Lands ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Order, with the name of Duke of</hi> Curland. <hi>And</hi> Livonia <hi>having been the Subject and Theatre of many wars between the</hi> Polanders, Muſcovites, <hi>and</hi> Swedes; <hi>theſe laſt did at length become Maſters of it, and have it in poſſeſſion ſtill. So that there is no more remaining of the</hi> Teutonick Order, <hi>but ſome Commanderies ſcattered here and there in</hi> Germany. <hi>And the Great Maſter hath his Seat and Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at</hi> Mergenthal.</p>
            <p>They wear on a white Mantle a plain black Croſs. The Dignity of Grand Maſter is generally held by ſome Great and Honorable Perſon; and in the Great Aſſembly he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth place of all Biſhops. The preſent is the Baron of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;</hi> and the Grand Maſter before him was <hi>Leopold Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam,</hi> only Brother to the Emperor <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Third.</p>
            <p>From hence we travelled to <hi>Lauterbach,</hi> near which we paſſed through a Wood, and found a Noble Church up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the top of a high Hill, which being much frequented by Pilgrims, they have made handſome ſtone Stairs from the bottom to the top: then to <hi>Rotenburg,</hi> and lodged at <hi>Burgperner,</hi> and the next day by <hi>Schantzbach</hi> we came to <hi>Nurenberg. Rotenburg</hi> is an Imperial City, which ſome have likened unto <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for its Situation upon hilly places, and many Turrets in it. It is Situated near
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57700:33"/> the head of the River <hi>Tauber,</hi> which may be accounted the ſecond River of <hi>Franconia,</hi> paſſing by <hi>Rottingen, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> and <hi>Werthaim,</hi> where it runneth into the <hi>Main.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nurenberg</hi> is the faireſt City that I ſaw in <hi>Germany;</hi> the Houſes moſt of them of Free-ſtone, very high; and divers of them painted on the outſide, and adorned with gilded Balls on the top; many are of ſix or ſeven Stories high. <hi>Der Herr Peller</hi> hath one of the faireſt. The City is very populous and full of Trade, although it ſtands in a barren Country, and wants a Navigable River. The three beſt Churches are the <hi>Hoſpital Church,</hi> lately built very fair; St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> which is very large, with two high Steeples in the Front; and St. <hi>Sebald</hi> the beſt of the three. The Body of St. <hi>Sebald</hi> being laid upon a Cart drawn with Oxen, in that place where the Oxen ſtood ſtill, they buried the Body, and erected this Church in his memory. In this Church is a Crucifix of Wood, very well carved, and eſteemed at a high rate. The Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix without the Church is very great, and of a black colour: and ſome fancy that the <hi>Raht Herrn,</hi> or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of the Town, have repoſited a Treaſure within it. The Pulpit is well carved and gilded, and the whole Church ſo ſtately, that it may paſs in the firſt rank of <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches; that Religion being here practiſed in its ſplendour. The Prieſt every morning reads the Scripture to the people for half an hour, or preacheth a Sermon. The Town-houſe is well worth the ſeeing: In it the Hall is ſpacious, as alſo the Chambers, and furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with good Pictures, and Stones well gilded and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with white and gold, green and gold, dark coloured and gold, and the like. There is one Picture of moſt of the Great Perſons in <hi>Germany</hi> entertained in the Great Hall; another of the three Brothers of <hi>Saxony;</hi> one of an Elephant as big as the life; a piece of St. <hi>John</hi> and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57700:33"/> St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and another of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> both by <hi>Albert Durer:</hi> but the moſt rare piece is that of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> by the ſame Maſter, with this Inſcription:
<q>Albertus Durer Almang faciebat poſt Virginis partum, 1507.</q> Another excellent one is that of St. <hi>Luke</hi> drawing the Picture of our Saviour and the bleſſed Virgin. Over the Gate at the entrance of the Shambles is a large Oxe carved in Wood, and painted over, with this Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</p>
            <q>
               <l>
                  <hi>Omnia habent ortus ſuaque incrementa, ſed ecce</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Quem cernis, nunquam Bos fuit hic, Vitulus.</hi>
               </l>
            </q>
            <p>The Caſtle ſtandeth upon a high Hill, from whence the Town makes a handſome ſhow: In it are obſervable a very deep well, the Emperors Chappel, his Picture, and the Pictures of the Electors; good Night pieces; and one of a man behind a white Curtain tranſparent, very well expreſſed. The Armour of <hi>Hebbele van Gailinghen</hi> the great Sorcerer is here ſhown; and in the Wall of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle the marks of his Horſes feet, when he leaped from thence over the <hi>Town ditch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The new Fountain was not then finiſhed; but the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua's in Braſs made for it were excellent; the Sea-Horſes large, the Sea-Nymphs much bigger than the life; and <hi>Neptune,</hi> who was to ſtand on the top, is above three yards and a half high. When I came firſt into this place, I was not a little ſurprized to behold the fairneſs of the Houſes, handſome Sreets, different Habits, induſtrious People, and neatneſs in all things, more than I had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in <hi>German</hi> Cities before; and no place hath grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter number of curious Artificers in Steel, Braſs, Ivory,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57700:34"/> Wood, wherein they work at an extraordinary cheap rate; and there are Officers to inſpect and enquire into the works of Artificers, that they be true, perfect, and without fraud: they make ſtrong and handſome Clock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work. The King of <hi>Poland</hi> preſented the Grand Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or with a very noble Clock, who took ſo much delight in it, that when it required ſome mending (the <hi>Turks</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ignorant in Clock-work) he ſent it from <hi>Adrianople</hi> as far as <hi>Nurenburg,</hi> to be ſet in order again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus,</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> was more magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently received and entertained in this City, than in any other of <hi>Germany;</hi> which ſo incenſed <hi>Wallenſteyn,</hi> that he afterwards encamped before their Town, and did great ſpoil upon their Territories: But the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> marched thither towards their Relief, and from thence towards <hi>Lutzen,</hi> where in a bloody Battel he loſt his life.</p>
            <p>The River <hi>Pegnitz</hi> runneth through <hi>Nurnberg,</hi> and hath divers Stone Bridges over it; and below the Town, joyning with the River <hi>Rednitz,</hi> runneth into the River <hi>Main</hi> at <hi>Bamberg;</hi> and the <hi>Main</hi> runs at laſt into the <hi>Rhine.</hi> The <hi>Reduitz</hi> ariſeth at <hi>Weiſsenberg,</hi> and is not far from the River <hi>Altmul,</hi> which runneth into the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube,</hi> towards <hi>Regenſburg.</hi> Upon this convenience, <hi>Charles</hi> the Great deſigned to make a Communication of paſſage between the <hi>Danube</hi> and the <hi>Rhine;</hi> and made a <hi>Canale</hi> thirty paces broad between the <hi>Rednitz</hi> and the <hi>Altmul,</hi> to joyn thoſe Streams for the commodity of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage by Boat; but after he had proceeded two <hi>German</hi> miles in this work, Boggs, Rains, and his warlike Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions made him give over that noble Deſign, whereby there might have been a Commerce by water, from the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and even unto the <hi>Euxine Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="63" facs="tcp:57700:34"/>
            <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Lieutenant in <hi>Nero</hi>'s time, had a deſire to unite the River <hi>Soane</hi> and the <hi>Moſella;</hi> and to make a paſſage between the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> and the <hi>German</hi> Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; having been at the mouth of the <hi>Moſella</hi> by <hi>Coblentz,</hi> and paſſed from <hi>Chaalon</hi> upon the ſoft and noble River <hi>Araris</hi> or <hi>Soane</hi> unto <hi>Lyon,</hi> I cannot but think theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry goodly Streams, and fit for ſuch a purpoſe. The preſent King of <hi>France</hi> hath a deſign to unite the River <hi>Aude</hi> with the <hi>Garonne,</hi> and ſo to have a paſſage by Boat from the <hi>Mediterranean Sea</hi> by <hi>Tholouſe</hi> and <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> into the Ocean. When I travelled in thoſe parts, view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Country well, I thought it would be a difficult work, and ſo it proveth: but the King hath proceeded already very far therein.</p>
            <p>About four Leagues from <hi>Nurnberg</hi> lyeth <hi>Altdorff,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing unto it, made an Univerſity in the year 1623. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, when I was there, about 150 Scholars. The Phyſick Garden is handſome, and well ſtocked with Plants, to the number of two thouſand. Dr. <hi>Hoffman</hi> the <hi>Botanick</hi> and <hi>Anatomick Profeſſour,</hi> ſhew'd me many of the moſt rare of them; and preſented me with divers. The <hi>Anatomy</hi> School is not large; yet the only one in thoſe parts of <hi>Germany:</hi> And they have divers Curioſities pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in it, as the <hi>Skeleton</hi> of a Hart, of a Horſe, of a Man, of a Bear bigger than a Horſe: And ſome Pictures, as one of a <hi>Ninivite,</hi> and another of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which they take to be Ancient. Dr. <hi>Wagenſeyl,</hi> Profeſſour of Law and Hiſtory, brother to Captain <hi>Wagenſeyl,</hi> who travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with me from <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> invited us to lodge at his Houſe, and ſhew'd me his Library, and all his Rarities and Coyns, whereof he hath a good Collection, having lived in moſt places of <hi>Europe,</hi> and ſpeaks many Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages well; he gave me a piece of the firſt mony that was coined in <hi>Germany.</hi> In the Univerſity Library I
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57700:35"/> ſaw a fair <hi>Hortus Eyſtetenſis,</hi> and <hi>Youngerman</hi>'s Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Plants by his own hand.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Nurnberg</hi> I met with the Son and the Secretary to the <hi>Holland</hi> Ambaſſador in <hi>Turky,</hi> who had travelled hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther over-land from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> in their return into the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> travelling in <hi>Greek</hi> Habits.</p>
            <p>From hence I went to <hi>Newmarkt,</hi> a good Town in the upper <hi>Palatinate</hi> belonging to the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and the next day through <hi>Heinmaw,</hi> ſubject to the Duke of <hi>Newburg,</hi> to <hi>Regensburg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ratiſbona, Regenſburg, Auguſta Tiberii, Colonia Quarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum,</hi> the chief place of the <hi>Roman</hi> Forces in this limit of the Empire, where the fourth <hi>Italick</hi> Legion had a conſtant ſtation; was made a Colony by <hi>Tiberius</hi> in the year, as ſome conceive, of the Paſſion of our Saviour. It was much augmented and adorned by the Emperour <hi>Arnulphus,</hi> who had a great affection for this place, ſo pleaſantly ſeated, and in a good Country. Here the River <hi>Regen</hi> runs into the <hi>Danube;</hi> from whence it was called <hi>Regenſburg.</hi> There are two Bridges, one of wood below the Town, and another Bridge of ſtone of about fifteen Arches; which is the faireſt ſtone Bridge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Danube.</hi> It is an Imperial City, but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome acknowledgment to the Duke of <hi>Bavaria:</hi> And although it be ſtrongly fortified, yet it was taken by the <hi>Swedes</hi> in the <hi>German</hi> wars. There are many fair build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in it, both private and publick; and though I am not able to confirm what ſome report, that there as many Churches and Chappels in this City, as there are dayes in the year; yet are there many fair Churches and Convents: As the Cathedral of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in the South-ſide of which is the Picture of St. <hi>Peter</hi> in a ſhip; and on the North a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of the Apoſtles firſt Miſſion. In the <hi>Piazza</hi> ſtands a neat little Church, the Convent of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> founded
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57700:35"/> by St. <hi>Wolfgangus</hi> Biſhop of this place, the Convent of St. <hi>Emerammus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ratiſbone,</hi> a Saint of great Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration here, though but of little mention or name in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts. The name of <hi>Albertus Magnus,</hi> Biſhop of this place, hath alſo added unto the Fame of <hi>Regenſburg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that which chiefly promoteth its luſtre, is the General Diet or Parliament, which is often held in this City, and is not to be called in any part out of <hi>Germany;</hi> and the place is not unfit for the accommodation of ſuch a noble Convention, as are the Eſtates of <hi>Germany.</hi> The Vice-Marſhal taketh care to provide Lodgings reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively to their perſons, and ſeeth that all things be brought hither, and at a juſt price; that the Hall or Place of Aſſembly be furniſhed and adorned ſutably to the dignity of the Perſons convened, and hath an eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al eye and regard towards the Publick ſafety. By this Convention the great Concerns of <hi>Germany</hi> are much ſecured, and their peace and quiet Eſtabliſhed. Wherein <hi>Germany</hi> ſeems to have a better advantage than <hi>Italy;</hi> For <hi>Italy</hi> being likewiſe divided into many Dominions and Principalities, hath no Common Diet or Great Council, whereby to proceed for their Publick ſafety: Which makes them often ſo divided in their common Concerns in times of Danger, and when they moſt need a joynt Combination.</p>
            <p>I entred the notable River <hi>Danubius</hi> at this place, which hath already run a good courſe, and paſſed by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fair Towns or Cities; as the large City of <hi>Ulme</hi> in <hi>Swabenland,</hi> where it beginneth to be Navigable; as alſo <hi>Donawert, Neuburg,</hi> and <hi>Ingolſtadt,</hi> and hath already received the conſiderable River of <hi>Licus</hi> or <hi>Leck,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Commodities of that great Trading City of <hi>Augſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> are brought into it. When I firſt embarked at <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſburg,</hi> I thought I might have taken leave of the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:57700:36"/> not far below <hi>Vienna,</hi> but an opportunity made me ſee this great Stream beyond <hi>Belgrade,</hi> as I have declared in another Account of my Travels.</p>
            <p>The firſt day we paſſed by <hi>Thonawſteyn,</hi> where there is a Caſtle ſeated upon a high Rock, and came to <hi>Pfeter</hi> or <hi>Vetera Caſtra</hi> of old, now but an ordinary place. The Boats upon the <hi>Danube</hi> are generally painted black and white, are flat bottom'd, and broad at the Head and Stern; there is a Chamber built in the middle; and the Rudder is very large, to be able to command the Boat where the River is rapid, and of a ſwift Courſe.</p>
            <p>The next day we came to <hi>Straubing,</hi> a handſome walled Town, belonging to the Duke of <hi>Bavaria;</hi> the Streets are ſtreight; and there is a Tower in the Market-place, painted all over with green and gold-colour: There is alſo a Bridge of wood over the <hi>Danube.</hi> We paſſed by <hi>Swartz</hi> in the Afternoon, where the Church is ſeated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Hill, and is frequented by Pilgrims, and lodged at <hi>Deckendorff,</hi> where there is another Bridge. Near this Town comes into the <hi>Danube</hi> that conſiderable River <hi>Iſer,</hi> or <hi>Iſara,</hi> having paſſed by divers conſiderable Towns; as <hi>Landſhut, Friſing,</hi> and <hi>München,</hi> the Seat of <hi>Ferdinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus Maria,</hi> Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> Great Steward of the Empire, and at preſent the firſt of the Secular Electors, and he is to take place immediately after the King of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,</hi> it being ſo concluded on at the Treaty of <hi>Munſter,</hi> where <hi>Maximilian</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> was allowed to hold the Electorſhip, which was confirmed upon him by the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Second, when he excluded <hi>Frederick</hi> the Fifth, Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> and in lieu hereof there was an eighth Electorſhip erected for the <hi>Palatinate</hi> Family, who alſo, if the <hi>Bavarian</hi> branch doth fail, are to re-enter into their ancient Electorſhip, and the other newly erected is to be aboliſhed.</p>
            <pb n="67" facs="tcp:57700:36"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday, November</hi> the fifteenth, we came by <hi>Wilſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> to <hi>Paſſaw, Patavia,</hi> or <hi>Boiodurum,</hi> a long and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble City in the lower <hi>Bavaria,</hi> or <hi>Bayern,</hi> made up of three Towns, <hi>Iltſtadt, Paſſaw,</hi> and <hi>Innſtadt,</hi> at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the River <hi>Inne,</hi> the <hi>Danube,</hi> and the <hi>Iltz.</hi> As Towns are commonly of great Antiquity which are built at the Confluence of great Rivers, for the Strength of the Situation and convenience of Commerce; ſo is this accounted ancient, as being a <hi>Roman</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, and the place of the <hi>Caſtra Batava</hi> in old times.</p>
            <p>The Church of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> is ſtately, beſides other fair Churches. The Biſhop, who is Lord of the City, hath a ſtrong Palace upon a Hill; his Revenues are large, and beſides what he poſſeſſeth hereabouts, he hath the tenth part of the notable great Lead-Mine at <hi>Bleyberg</hi> in <hi>Carinthia.</hi> This place had lately ſuffered much by fire; but a good part was rebuilt, and very fairly after the <hi>Italian</hi> manner: So that this may well be reckoned as one of the ten conſiderable Cities, which are upon the <hi>Danube,</hi> accounting from <hi>Ulme</hi> unto <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade,</hi> as <hi>Ulme, Ingolſtadt, Ratiſbone, Paſſaw, Lintz, Vienna, Preſburg, Strigonium, Buda, Belgrade;</hi> all which from <hi>Ratiſbone</hi> I had the opportunity to ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the end of my Journey. Near to a Wall over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the great Church at <hi>Paſſaw,</hi> which was then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing, I ſaw a vaſt Head cut in ſtone, the Mouth whereof was two ſpans wide, and the reſt proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. The River <hi>Iltz,</hi> which runneth in here from the North, is conſiderable for the Pearls which are found in it; and the noble River <hi>Inne</hi> or <hi>Oenus,</hi> from the South, is the greateſt River which hath yet entred the <hi>Danube;</hi> having paſſed by <hi>Inſbrug,</hi> and taken in the River <hi>Saltz,</hi> upon which ſtands <hi>Saltzburg;</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing in the <hi>Alpes</hi> in ſuch a high Country as <hi>Tirolis,</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:57700:37"/> it runneth in here with a great force, and addeth much unto the ſwiftneſs of the <hi>Danube.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the Sixteenth we came to <hi>Lintz,</hi> the chief City in the higher <hi>Auſtria,</hi> not very great, but as neat and handſome a City as moſt in <hi>Germany.</hi> There is in it a very great Market-place, with never a bad Houſe in it, the whole Town built of a very white Free-ſtone; and the Caſtle upon the Hill is of Modern Building, and very large. There is alſo a Bridge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Danube.</hi> The Imperial Forces rendezvouſed here when <hi>Solyman</hi> came to <hi>Vienna.</hi> This was alſo beſieged by the Peaſants of <hi>Auſtria</hi> in the time of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> the Second; they having got a Body together of Forty thouſand men, and many pieces of Ordnance, but were ſtoutly repulſed after many Aſſaults, and at laſt overcome by <hi>Papenheim.</hi> Not far below <hi>Lintz</hi> the River <hi>Draun</hi> enters the <hi>Danube;</hi> this cometh from the <hi>Gemundner Sea,</hi> or <hi>Lacus Felicis,</hi> paſſing by <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pack, Weltz,</hi> and other Towns, and hath a noted Cataract or Fall of Waters.</p>

            </p>
            <p>It was an ancient place of Habitation in the time of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and called <hi>Vindobona,</hi> as the Learned <hi>Petrus Lambecius</hi> hath at large declared, where the <hi>Claſſis Iſtrica</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:57700:40"/> ſometimes lay, and the tenth <hi>German Legion</hi> had its ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; all this ſhoar or ſide of the <hi>Danube</hi> being famous for the actions of <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours againſt the <hi>Marco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manni</hi> and <hi>Quadi,</hi> who poſſeſſed the Country on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the River, and eſpecially for the wars of <hi>Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Philoſophus,</hi> who notably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated thoſe Nations, and who, as <hi>Aurelius Victor</hi> (who was Governour of <hi>Sirmium</hi> in <hi>Pannonia inferior,</hi> in the time of <hi>Conſtantius</hi>) affirmeth, fell ſick at <hi>Carnuntum,</hi> now <hi>Petronel,</hi> and died at <hi>Vindobona,</hi> now <hi>Vienna.</hi> And to confirm the Antiquity hereof, beſides what <hi>Wolfgangus Lazius</hi> hath delivered, not many years ſince ſome Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities were found. For in the year 1662. when a wall was digged up near the old Palace, the workmen digging ſtill on below the Foundation, found a Stone Trough or Coffin, containing hard Earth and Bones, with a ſmall Gold Coyn, a Glaſs Urn encloſed in a Braſs one, an Iron Knife like a <hi>Siceſpita,</hi> or Knife uſed about Sacrifices, a little Roll or Scroll of pure Gold, ſhut up with a Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den cover at both ends, wherein was an Inſcription in ſtrange Characters: Not far from the Sepulchral Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were found a Head in Braſs, a Brazen <hi>Patera,</hi> Lamps, Lachrymatories, and other Veſſels, and a Copper Coyn of <hi>Antoninus Caracalla.</hi> The writing in the Golden Scroll, which no man could read, was conceived by the Learned <hi>Lambecius</hi> to be the old <hi>Pannonian</hi> Character, and that this might be the Monument of ſome <hi>Pannonian</hi> Prieſt in the days of <hi>Caracalla,</hi> who, as good Authors deliver, ſpent ſome time about theſe parts.</p>
            <p>It is ſeated on the South-ſide of the <hi>Danube,</hi> on the <hi>ripa Romana,</hi> that ſide neareſt to <hi>Rome,</hi> and many <hi>Roman</hi> Colonies, according to the uſual poſition of <hi>Roman</hi> Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, both upon this River and the <hi>Rhine,</hi> as may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified in <hi>Colen, Bonna, Andarnach, Coblentz, Ments,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57700:40"/> Wormes, Spier,</hi> and <hi>Straſburg.</hi> And in like manner in the old <hi>Roman</hi> Stations, on the South or <hi>Roman</hi> ſide of the <hi>Danube,</hi> which were in no ſmall number in or near the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> ſhoar, as <hi>Carnuntum,</hi> or <hi>Petronel, Viſchmund,</hi> or <hi>Aquinoctium, Eberſdorff,</hi> or <hi>Ala Nova, Melck,</hi> or <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, Arlape,</hi> or <hi>Pechlarne, Lentia,</hi> or <hi>Lintz;</hi> for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they better ſecured their Conqueſts, and hindred the incurſions of the Barbarians before them.</p>
            <p>It is not ſeated upon the main ſtream of the <hi>Danube,</hi> but by a branch thereof; for the River running through a low Country; it is divided into ſeveral Streams, and maketh many Iſlands. A ſmall River named <hi>Wien,</hi> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by the Eaſt part of this City, and entreth the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube</hi> below it, which upon floods doth often much hurt, yet ſometimes low and very ſhallow, ſo as I have ſtepped over it; ſome will have it to give the Name unto this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: it divideth part of the Suburbs from it, and hath divers Bridges over it. For that we may have a diſtinct apprehenſion of <hi>Vienna,</hi> we muſt conſider the City and Suburbs thereof; the Suburbs are very great, and not without fair Houſes, Gardens, Walks, and all Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations at large.</p>
            <p>The City it ſelf is that walled and fortified part, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned not only for convenience of Habitation, but alſo to ſuſtain a Siege, or any Attack from the <hi>Turk,</hi> and is now ſeparated from the Suburbs by a fair <hi>Eſplanade,</hi> or open Ground, above a Musket ſhot over. The Houſes near the wall were pulled down ſince the laſt Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> war, when they were in ſome fear that the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Forces about <hi>Gran</hi> and <hi>New-heuſel,</hi> would move towards them. It is fortified <hi>a la moderna,</hi> with ten Baſtions towards the Land, and a very deep Ditch, into which they can let the <hi>Danube:</hi> and with two other Baſtions towards the water, on that part of the River
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57700:41"/> which lieth on the North-ſide of the Town. The Baſtions are large; upon one of them I ſaw Count <hi>Souches</hi> muſter a good part of the Militia of the City. The Ditch is large and very deep, into which although they can let in the River, yet it is commonly kept dry, leſt they might incommode their deep Cellars. There are two walls, the one old and inward, little conſiderable at preſent, built at firſt with the ranſome of our King <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt, who in his return from the Holy War, was detained Priſoner by the Duke of <hi>Auſtria</hi> upon the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1192. The <hi>Auſtrians</hi> pretending they had received ſome affront from the King at <hi>Joppa,</hi> and that he had taken down the Enſign and Banner of Duke <hi>Leopold</hi> in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous way. The other outward of a great breadth, made of Earth, and faced with Brick, edged with Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, ſo well built, as to render this City one of the moſt conſiderable fortified places in <hi>Europe.</hi> The <hi>Eſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nade</hi> gently deſcendeth from the Town for three hundred Paces; there are very few Out-works.</p>
            <p>It is very uncertain who was the firſt Builder of <hi>Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and after it had been long built, it ran to decay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain for Four hundred years together, till <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> in the year 1158. did much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair it; and the ranſome afterwards of King <hi>Richard</hi> beautified it.</p>
            <p>The whole compaſs, taking in the Suburbs, makes a very large Circuit, but the City it ſelf, which is walled in, may be about three miles in Circumference, and is exceeding populous, as full of People, for the bigneſs of the place, as moſt of the great Cities. And I could not but take delight to behold ſo many Nations in it, as <hi>Turks, Tartars, Graecians, Tranſylvanians, Sclavonians, Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Croatians, Spaniards, Italians, French, Germans, Polanders, &amp;c.</hi> all in their proper Habits.</p>
            <pb n="75" facs="tcp:57700:41"/>
            <p>The chief Gates are ſix: 1. <hi>Stubnthor,</hi> or the <hi>Stuben Gate</hi> towards the Eaſt. 2. <hi>Karnterthor,</hi> or the <hi>Gate of Carinthia</hi> towards the South. 3. <hi>Burgthor,</hi> the <hi>Town Gate,</hi> or <hi>Caſtle Gate. 4. Schottenthor,</hi> or the <hi>Scotch Gate. 5. Newthor,</hi> or the <hi>Newgate;</hi> theſe two laſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Weſt: And 6. the <hi>Gate of the red Tower</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North, which leadeth unto the Bridge over the <hi>Danube:</hi> and towards the water ſide, there is alſo a Port by the Emperours palace, and a Cloyſter or Nunnery in the Town hath the Name of a Port called <hi>Himmel port,</hi> or the <hi>Gate of Heaven.</hi> The five firſt of theſe Gates are vaulted and arched with long paſſages through the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall, and have good Bridges of Wood, with Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridges to paſs over the Town ditch: The ſixth is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Tower, and leads to the Bridges of the <hi>Danube:</hi> For that River running here in a flat low Country, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth its ſtreams, ſo that to paſs it quite over, there are at preſent ſeven long Bridges made up of many thouſand Tree laid one by another, after their way of making Bridges. There is alſo a Bridge within the City of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna,</hi> called the <hi>Hochbrug,</hi> or <hi>High-bridge,</hi> which is made by the croſſing of two Streets at equal Angles; the ground of one ſtreet being as high as the tops of the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the other, ſo that to continue it, they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to build a Bridge or Arch in the <hi>Lower-ſtreet,</hi> to let the upper paſs over it.</p>
            <p>The City is fairly built of ſtone, and well paved; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Houſes are of ſix ſtories high; they are ſomewhat flat roofed after the <hi>Italian</hi> way; the Streets are not narrow, but the compaſs of ground will not admit them to be very broad; and their Buildings are remarkable both above and below ground; their Cellars are very deep. To ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie my curioſity, I went into ſome of them, and found four Cellars one under another; they were arched, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57700:42"/> had two pair of Stairs to deſcend into them. Some have an open ſpace in the middle of each roof, to let the Air out of one Cellar into another, and from the loweſt an <hi>adit</hi> or <hi>tube</hi> unto the top, to let the Air in and out from the ſtreet, ſomewhat after the manner of the Mines.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aenaeas Sylvius,</hi> about two hundred years ſince, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the City of <hi>Nurnburg,</hi> among other expreſſions lets fall this: <hi>Cuperent Scotorum Reges tam egregiè quam mediocres Cives</hi> Norinbergenſes <hi>habitare.</hi> The Kings of <hi>Scots</hi> would be content to dwell ſo well as the middle ſort of Citizens of <hi>Nurnburg.</hi> I muſt confeſs, when I firſt entred <hi>Nurnburg,</hi> I was much ſurpriſed to ſee ſuch a noble, large, ſpruce, rich, and well built City: But <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna</hi> doth alſo deſerve the commendation which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth it: <hi>Ubi Palatia digna Regibus &amp; Templa quae mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rari</hi> Italia <hi>poſſit.</hi> Where there are Palaces fit for Kings and Churches, which <hi>Italy</hi> may admire.

            <p>There are alſo many fair Churches, rich Convents, and Conventual Churches; as that of the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> of the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> of the <hi>Benedictines,</hi> of St. <hi>Nicholas;</hi> In this Church I could not but take notice of the late Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chral Monuments of Count <hi>Strozzi</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach.</hi> The <hi>Dominican</hi> Convent is very fair. The <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtines</hi> have a large Church, in the middle whereof they have built a Chappel after the manner of the Holy Houſe at <hi>Loretto;</hi> upon the top of which hang the Colours ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> many of which Enſigns are not ſquare like ours, but made Eſcucheon-wiſe, ſome fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Circles, wherein are expreſſed half Moons. The <hi>Jeſuites</hi> Colledges are large, who ſeldome fail of noble Convents, eſpecially in places where they have ſo good footing as in this. The Front of one of their Colledges openeth into a fair <hi>Piazza,</hi> in the middle whereof ſtands a large and high compoſite Column of Copper upon a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtal of white ſtone, with four Angels with Eſcucheons, and on the top the bleſſed Virgin; Inſcriptions alſo, in which the Emperour dedicates <hi>Auſtria</hi> unto her Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and Tuition. In another Market-place, where the Town-houſe is, there is a handſome <hi>Statua</hi> of Juſtice in Copper.</p>
            <p>I could not but obſerve the <hi>Scotch</hi> Church and Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, which gave alſo the name unto the <hi>Scotch</hi> Gate of the City, becauſe I ſomewhat wondered how the <hi>Scots</hi> in old time ſhould be ſo conſiderable in this place, but I found by Information, and the Account of <hi>Lazius</hi> and <hi>Matthaeus Merian</hi> in <hi>High-dutch,</hi> that this Convent was in
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57700:44"/> former times a great Receptacle for the <hi>Scots</hi> in their long Pilgrimage unto <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> founded and endowed by Duke <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, in memory of St. <hi>Gregory:</hi> and it may ſeem leſs ſtrange that the <hi>Scots</hi> ſhould have a Convent here, and be numerous in theſe parts in former Ages, if we conſider that St. <hi>Colman,</hi> one of the Saints of the greateſt Veneration in this Country was a <hi>Scotchman,</hi> and ſaid to be of the Royal Blood of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who, in his paſſage to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was murdered by the <hi>Baurs</hi> or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try people at <hi>Stockerau,</hi> four <hi>German</hi> miles from <hi>Vienna,</hi> and hanged on a Tree, where, as the Story goes, his Body remained uncorrupted for a year and a half, and divers Miracles being affirmed of it, it was taken down, and honourably interred near <hi>Stockerau;</hi> but by <hi>Meginhard</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Aichſtadt</hi> it was tranſlated unto <hi>Melk,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſent into <hi>Hungary,</hi> and his Head kept a long time at <hi>Stullweiſſenburg,</hi> or <hi>Alba Regalis,</hi> according to the Account which is here given of this Saint.</p>
            <p>The Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi> is alſo conſiderable, not for its Splendour but Antiquity, as being accounted the ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt in the City, ſtanding in a place where in old time there ſtood an Altar in honour of <hi>Domitian,</hi> called <hi>Ara Flaviana.</hi> In this Church lieth the Body of that famous and learned Perſon <hi>Wolfgangus Lazius,</hi> with this Epitaph or Inſcription:</p>

            <pb n="79" facs="tcp:57700:44"/>
            <p>In the Church of the <hi>Capucines</hi> Convent, are interred the Emperour <hi>Matthias</hi> and his Empreſs, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs <hi>Maria,</hi> wife to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Third, who out of their Devotion and Humility, choſe to be buried in a Church of this poor Order. And the <hi>Capucines</hi> not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of Magnificent Monuments in their Churches, as in the Churches of other Orders, no Tombs are erected worthy ſo great an Emperour, and ſuch Empreſſes.</p>
            <p>But the Cathedral Church of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> containeth divers Monuments of many Princes and Great Perſons, and is a large ſtately Building, but ſomewhat dark by reaſon of the thick painted Glaſs: not covered with Lead, but with Tiles of wood, which is the only blemiſh thereof, yet makes a good ſhow. The Steeple and Spire are very remarkable, as being high, large, ſtrong, and handſome. On the top or Weathercock-place of the Spire ſtands a Croſs under a Star and half Moon, according to the Figure I have elſewhere ſet down, which the People think to be of Gold, or at leaſt very well gilded: and in the time of Thunder and Lightning it looked pale and whitiſh.</p>
            <p>They have this Account how theſe came firſt to be ſet up in this place: That when <hi>Solyman</hi> the Magnificent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged <hi>Vienna,</hi> perceiving the Forces in the City to be obſtinate, he had an intent to batter down the Steeple a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their ears: But ſome of the <hi>Baſſa's</hi> and great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, advertiſing him how unprofitable a buſineſs it would prove, and withal when he took the City, what an honour it would be unto him to have ſuch a Noble Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramid in his Dominions: He ſent word into the Town, That he was willing to ſpare the Steeple, upon condition that they would ſet up the half Moon and Star (the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh</hi> Arms) upon the top thereof. They returned An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that they would, if he would ſend the ſame
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57700:45"/> unto them, which he did, and they placed it where it ſtandeth.</p>
            <p>This Spire hath the largeſt Crockets I have obſerved in any, they being above a yard long, and adorned with foliage work. The Spire of <hi>Landſhute</hi> in <hi>Bavaria,</hi> is accounted the higheſt in <hi>Germany;</hi> that of <hi>Straſburg</hi> the neateſt and faireſt; and this of <hi>Vienna</hi> the largeſt and ſtrongeſt. And therefore it is no wonder that when the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Boſna</hi> formerly came unto <hi>Vienna,</hi> they ſo often viewed and admired this Fabrick, and plainly ſaid that all the mony in their Country was not ſufficient to have built it.</p>
            <p>This Steeple is accounted about four hundred ſixty and five foot high, being about half way up three hundred and thirty eight ſteps. Beſides other Hills, I could ſee <hi>Haimburger</hi> Hill within two miles of <hi>Preſburg,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> which the long Courſe of the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube</hi> rendred very pleaſant and delightful unto the eye. In the Chamber or Room from whence I had this proſpect, there is a Clock, whoſe Caſe being of wood, was in part burnt down by Lightning, and therefore there is water always kept in this place to extinguiſh the fire, and a man continually watcheth in the place where the Bells hand. There is alſo an Inſtrument of wood, or wooden Bells or Hammers, which they make uſe of from <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friday</hi> till <hi>Eaſter-ſunday,</hi> all the time that our Saviour was in the Grave, during which time they permit no Bells to ring.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The Univerſity of <hi>Vienna</hi> is alſo remarkable, if we conſsider the Antiquity thereof, the number of Scholars, their courſe of Studies, their accommodations, privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and advancements. This is ſaid to have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by <hi>Albertus</hi> the Third, above three hundred years paſt; and their Rules, Orders, and Statutes to have been borrowed from the Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Students were diſtinguiſhed into four Diviſions or Nations; who, beſides the General, have their particular Rules and Officers, and were comprehended under the <hi>Claſſis</hi> of <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> Nations of the <hi>Rhine, Hungarians,</hi> and <hi>Saxons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Diviſion were contained the <hi>Friulians,</hi> all of the Dioceſe of <hi>Trent,</hi> all <hi>Italy,</hi> with the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces beyond the Mountains. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

            </p>
            <p>In the third <hi>Claſſis,</hi> or <hi>Natio Hungariae,</hi> were contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Hungarians, Bohemians, Polonians, Moravians, Scla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonians,</hi> all that ſpeak the <hi>Sclavonian</hi> Tongue, and alſo <hi>Germans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the <hi>Claſſis,</hi> or <hi>Natio Saxonum,</hi> were reduced <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Weſtphalians, Friſlanders, Turingians, Miſnians, Brandenburgers, Pruſſians. Livonians, Luſatians, Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranians,</hi> with the <hi>Ultramarine</hi> Kingdoms of <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland, Sweden, Norway,</hi> and <hi>Denmark.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Diviſions take up all the Nations of <hi>Europe;</hi> and indeed there are Students here of many Nations: and upon Contentions and Differences the ſeveral <hi>Claſſes</hi> will hold unto their own, and take parts, and bandy againſt each other, but will all unite and hold together in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences with Towns-men or Jews, which happen ſometimes unto an high degree.</p>
            <p>They follow here the old beaten way of Knowledge: and I met with few who had any good inſight in new <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy;</hi> but there are many good <hi>Philologers,</hi> and are well verſed in Languages, Hiſtory and Antiquity: and there are many Learned Men either educated here, or come from other parts. Some who had taken notice of the <hi>Royal Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> were very inquiſitive after it; and when I had ſatisfied them in all particulars, were very much pleaſed therewith. If they ſhould fall into the way of <hi>Experimental Philoſophy,</hi> being very induſtrious, 'tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probable they may do much therein, and they were ſure to have the countenance of the Emperour. I found them alſo much affected with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Society in other parts of <hi>Germany.</hi> At the Univerſity of <hi>Altorff</hi> I was much enquired of concerning it: and a Magiſtrate of <hi>Nurnburg,</hi> who had got a <hi>Teleſcope</hi> from <hi>London,</hi> invited
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57700:47"/> me to his Houſe, to practiſe the way of uſing it. <hi>Der Herr von Adlerſhelme</hi> of <hi>Leipſick,</hi> a Perſon of great Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, was very inquiſitive after the ſame <hi>Society.</hi> And of late years the <hi>Curioſi</hi> of <hi>Germany</hi> have held Learned Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions and Correſpondence, and printed their <hi>Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations</hi> at <hi>Leipſick.</hi> And ſince my Return into <hi>England,</hi> I have been ſolicited from <hi>Caſſovia</hi> in <hi>Upper Hungary,</hi> to ſend the <hi>Tranſactions</hi> into thoſe Parts.</p>
            <p>During my ſtay at <hi>Vienna,</hi> I went unto a publick Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my of a Woman that was beheaded: the <hi>Lecture</hi> laſted ſo long, that the Body was Nineteen days unburied. It was performed by a Learned Phyſician, Dr. <hi>Wolfſtregel,</hi> who read in <hi>Latin</hi> to the ſatisfaction of all perſons. What I moſt particularly obſerved therein was this, The <hi>Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midal Muſcles</hi> very plain and large; the <hi>Uterus</hi> larger than is uſually obſerved; the <hi>Cartilago Enſiformis</hi> double; the <hi>Lungs</hi> very black; the <hi>Eye</hi> was very well ſhown; he produced an artificial Eye of Ivory, and another large one of Paſtboard and Paper, contrived and made by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; the <hi>Muſcles</hi> of the <hi>Pharynx, Larynx, Os Hyoides,</hi> and the <hi>Tongue,</hi> after their diſſection, he reduced very handſomely into their proper places again, to ſhew their natural ſituation and poſition. The <hi>Anatomy-Theatre</hi> was of capacity to receive above an hundred perſons; and according to the cuſtome of other places, to avoid imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Spectators, a piece of Mony was given for admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Of <hi>Anatomy-Theatres,</hi> until of late, there have been few in <hi>Germany,</hi> or none. And when I was in the <hi>Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my-School</hi> at <hi>Altorff,</hi> near <hi>Nurenburg,</hi> that learned and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Profeſſor, Dr. <hi>Mauritius Hoffmannus,</hi> told me that the ſame was the Firſt in <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paulus de Sorbait,</hi> Prime Profeſſor, Phyſician unto <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leonora</hi> the Empreſs Dowager, and Knight of <hi>Hungary,</hi> was the <hi>Rector Magnificus. Zwelfer,</hi> who writ <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57700:48"/> upon the Diſpenſatory of Auſburg,</hi> was in great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute in <hi>Vienna,</hi> and had built for himſelf a noble Houſe in the City, but he died ſome time before my coming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>In fine, the Univerſity is noble, their Advancements conſiderable, their Priviledges great, and they have the power of life and death, from ancient and latter Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of their Dukes and Emperours.</p>
            <p>But the greateſt luſtre unto <hi>Vienna</hi> is the Reſidence of the preſent Emperour <hi>Leopoldus;</hi> he was born in the year 1638. he was Son unto the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Third; he was baptized by the Names of <hi>Leopoldus, Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius, Franciſcus, Balthazar, Joſephus, Felicianus.</hi> His eldeſt Brother <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> died of the Small Pox in his Fathers time. His Brother <hi>Carolus Joſephus,</hi> Maſter of the <hi>Teutonick Order,</hi> dyed 1662. He married <hi>Margareta</hi> Infanta of <hi>Spain,</hi> daughter unto King <hi>Philip</hi> the Fourth, whoſe Children died Infants; a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, affable, grave, and worthy Prince, and ſeemed to me to live very happily here, in the love and honour of his People, Souldiers, and Clergy.</p>
            <p>His Perſon is grave and graceful; he hath the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Lip remarkably, his Chin long, which is taken for a good Phyſiognomical mark, and a ſign of a conſtant, placid, and little troubled mind. He is conceived to carry in his Face the lineaments of four of his Predeceſſours, that is, of <hi>Rudolphus</hi> the Firſt, of <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Firſt, of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Firſt. He was very affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate unto his Empreſs, who, though but young, was a modeſt, grave Princeſs, had a good aſpect, was zealous in her Religion, and an Enemy unto the Jews. He ſhewed alſo great reſpect and obſervance unto the Empreſs Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager <hi>Eleonora,</hi> who was a ſober and prudent Princeſs, well skilled in all kind of curious Works, and delighted
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57700:48"/> ſometimes to ſhoot at Deer from a Stand, or at other Game, out of her Coach. He was alſo very loving unto his Siſters, beautiful and good Ladies; whereof one, the eldeſt, was ſince married unto that Noble Prince <hi>Michael Wiſnowitzski,</hi> King of <hi>Poland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſpeaks four Languages, <hi>German, Italian, Spaniſh,</hi> and <hi>Latin.</hi> He is a great countenancer of Learned Men, and delighteth to read, and when occaſion permitteth, will paſs ſome hours at it. The worthy <hi>Petrus Lambe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> his Library Keeper, and who is in great eſteem with him, will uſually find out ſome Books for him which he conceiveth may be acceptable. While I was there he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended a Tranſlation of <hi>Religio Medici</hi> unto him, wherewith the Emperour was exceedingly pleaſed, and ſpake very much of it unto <hi>Lambecius,</hi> inſomuch that <hi>Lambecius</hi> asked me whether I knew the Author, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my own name, and whether he were living: And when he underſtood my near Relation to him, he became more kind and courteous than ever, and deſired me to ſend him that Book in the Original <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which he would put into the Emperours Library: and preſented me with a neat little <hi>Latin</hi> Book, called <hi>Princeps in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendio,</hi> written by the Emperours Father, <hi>Ferdinandus</hi> the Third.</p>
            <p>He is alſo skilful in Muſick, compoſeth well, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted much in it, both at his Palace and the Church, which makes ſo many Muſicians in <hi>Vienna;</hi> for no place abounds more with them; and in the Evening we ſeldom failed of Muſick in the Streets, and at our Windows: And the Emperours delight herein makes the Church-men take the greater care to ſet off their Church-muſick, for he goeth often to Church, and not to one, but divers, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the beſt Conventual Churches: and in his own Chappel ſome of his own Compoſitions are often play'd.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57700:49"/> He hath alſo excellent Muſick in his Palace, both Vocal and Inſtrumental; and his private Chappel is well ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, where beſides the excellent Muſick, there are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways eight or ten Counts, Pages to the Emperour, who ſerve at the Altar with white wax Torches in their hands; and after the manner of the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, divers <hi>Eunuchs</hi> to ſing.</p>
            <p>For his Recreations abroad, he delighteth much in Hunting, eſpecially of the wild Boar in due ſeaſons; I have known him bring home ſix Boars in a morning. Some ſtout perſons, particularly Count <hi>Nicholas Serini,</hi> would encounter a wild Boar alone, but at laſt he unfortunately periſhed by one, which hath made others more wary ſince; and therefore when the Boar is at a Bay, the Huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſo ſtand about him, that the Emperour, or other great perſons, may more ſafely make uſe of their Boar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpears upon him.</p>
            <p>Surely there are great numbers of them about the Country, for they are no unuſual or extraordinary Diſh in the City, though of a delicious and pleaſing taſte. They feed upon <hi>Acorns, Beech-maſt,</hi> and <hi>Cheſnuts,</hi> upon the ſpring or ſprout of <hi>Broom, Juniper,</hi> and <hi>Shrubs,</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the roots of <hi>Fern,</hi> and will range into Corn-fields, and come out of Forreſts into Vineyards. The Huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are notably verſed and skilful in that Game; for though they ſee it not, they will diſtinguiſh a wild from a common Swine, and gheſs whether that which they hunt be Male or Female, old or young, large or ſmall, fat or lean; and this they chiefly conjecture from their tread or foot, and the caſting their hindfeet out of the track of their forefeet.</p>
            <p>The Emperour being ſo good a Huntſman, it is the leſs wonder that he is eſteemed a good Horſman. Certain it is, that he hath a very noble Stable of Horſes, procured
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57700:49"/> from all parts, <hi>Turkiſh, Tartarian, Polonian, Tranſylvanian, Saxon, Bohemian, Hungarian, Naples, &amp;c.</hi> and they are well managed; and they ride them to the ſatisfaction of the Beholders.</p>
            <p>Having ſeen the <hi>Arſenal</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> the <hi>Stores</hi> at <hi>Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and the <hi>Naval Proviſions</hi> at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> I am not like to admire any other, eſpecially ſo far from the Sea, and looked for nothing of that nature in this place. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I found an <hi>Arſenal,</hi> and place for Naval Veſſels to be ſet out upon occaſion, and ſome thereof were employed in the laſt <hi>Turkiſh</hi> war, when they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to deſtroy the Bridge of Boats which the <hi>Turks</hi> had made over the <hi>Danube,</hi> a little above <hi>Gran</hi> and <hi>Bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han.</hi> They are built ſomewhat like <hi>Galleys,</hi> carry great Guns, and a good number of Souldiers, and will make a ſight upon the broad deep ſtream of the <hi>Danube,</hi> and may be handſomely brought into the Town behind one of the Baſtions, when the River is high; and hereof there are ſome at <hi>Rab</hi> and <hi>Komora,</hi> as I have declared elſewhere.</p>
            <p>The Emperour hath many Counſellors, great Souldiers and Courtiers about him; among which theſe ſeemed of greateſt Note.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Euſebius Wenceſlaus</hi> Duke <hi>de Sagan,</hi> Prince <hi>Lobko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witz,</hi> Pirme Counſellor, <hi>Hoff-meiſter,</hi> of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>Golden Fleece,</hi> a perſon of a grave and ſober Aſpect, ſomewhat blunt in converſation, but of a gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous temper, and free from all covetouſneſs, who ſpent his Revenues nobly, and unto his great reputation: He was chief Favorite unto the Emperour; and though ſome had no great opinion of his Abilities, yet he was the firſt that diſcovered the laſt <hi>Hungarian</hi> defection and revolt, whereby thoſe Noble Perſons, Count <hi>Peter Serini</hi> and <hi>Nadaſti</hi> (whom I ſaw at <hi>Vienna</hi>) were brought unto their ends.</p>

            <p>Sixty, or more, <hi>Pages,</hi> for the number is uncertain, and not limited; moſt of them <hi>Counts</hi> and <hi>Barons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Raymundus,</hi> Count <hi>de Montecuculi,</hi> was his <hi>General,</hi> Preſident of the Council of War, Governour of <hi>Rab</hi> and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57700:50"/> the Confines about it, and of the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Golden Fleece;</hi> a tall Perſon, ſomewhat lean, but hath a ſpirit in his look: he is one of the oldeſt Commanders in <hi>Europe,</hi> and performed good Service in <hi>Poland, Hungary, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> in many places, and is eſteemed a prudent, valiant, and ſucceſsful Commander.</p>
            <p>The Count <hi>de Souches</hi> was alſo a <hi>Commander</hi> of great Fame, and in high eſteem with the Emperour. He was a Native of <hi>Rochelle:</hi> he firſt ſerved the <hi>Swedes</hi> in the <hi>German</hi> wars, and was a Colonel, but upon ſome diſguſt he forſook the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and ſerved the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> and was made Governour of <hi>Brin,</hi> the ſecond Town in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravia.</hi> After the taking of <hi>Crembs</hi> in <hi>Auſtria,</hi> General <hi>Torſtenſon</hi> beſieged <hi>Brin,</hi> and ſent word unto the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <hi>de Souches,</hi> That if he refuſed to deliver up the Town he would give him no quarter. Who anſwered him, That he would not ask any, and alſo give none: and defended the place with ſuch reſolution, that after many Aſſaults, Underminings, and Attempts by <hi>Granado's, Torſtenſon</hi> was forced to riſe, after a Siege of four months, which was ſo advantagious unto <hi>Auſtria</hi> and the <hi>Imperial</hi> affairs, that the Emperour took eſpecial notice of him, made him a <hi>Baron,</hi> and of his <hi>Privy Council.</hi> He commanded alſo all the Forces in <hi>Vienna,</hi> and did notable Service in the laſt <hi>Turkiſh</hi> wars. He took the City of <hi>Nitra,</hi> or <hi>Nitria,</hi> not far from <hi>Strigonium</hi> or <hi>Gran;</hi> and took and ſlew ſix thouſand <hi>Turks</hi> which were ſent by the <hi>Vizier</hi> of <hi>Buda</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: a worthy Perſon, and of a good Aſpect. Count <hi>Souches</hi> the younger his Son, an Heroick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, is Governour of the ſtrong fortified place <hi>Leopold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtadt</hi> by <hi>Freiſtadt,</hi> a Perſon of great Civility, unto whom I was much obliged.</p>
            <p>Count <hi>Leſly,</hi> Nephew unto Count <hi>Leſly</hi> who was ſent Ambaſſadour to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to the <hi>Sultan</hi> from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57700:51"/> is a Commander worthy of that eſteem he hath with the Emperour; a Perſon of great Courage, Civility and Humanity, which I muſt ever acknowledge.</p>
            <p>The Courts of the Empreſs, and of the Empreſs Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager, are filled with Perſons of Note; and there are a great number of Souldiers in this place of great Fame, as the Marquiſs <hi>Pio, Spork, Cops,</hi> and many more. Many of the Clergy and Men of Learning, are in good eſteem with the Emperour; but the <hi>Jeſuites Milner</hi> and <hi>Bocca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi> are his near Favorites. Many Strangers, both Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and Scholars, have built their Fortunes here. And ſurely Strangers of parts and induſtry, ſo they be of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> are not like to raiſe their Fortunes any where better than in theſe parts.</p>
            <p>Though the Emperour goeth not to war in Perſon, yet hath he been ſucceſsful in his wars, eſpecially in the laſt Battel with the <hi>Turks</hi> at St. <hi>Godart,</hi> where the buſineſs was handſomly and actively managed, to ſet upon the body of the <hi>Turks,</hi> which had paſſed the River <hi>Rab,</hi> before the whole Forces of the <hi>Vizier</hi> could come over, to the great ſlaughter of the <hi>Janiſaries</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> who fought ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and were firſt put to a Retreat by the <hi>French</hi> Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For at firſt the <hi>Turks</hi> ſeemed to prevail, and had ſlain a great part of two Regiments of the <hi>Auxiliaries</hi> which came out of <hi>Franconia,</hi> and after their cuſtome, had cut off their Heads.</p>
            <p>Among the many notable things in <hi>Vienna,</hi> the <hi>Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> Library is very remarkable. He who hath ſeen the <hi>Bodleian</hi> Library at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and the <hi>Vatican</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> would be much ſurpriſed to find ſuch a notable one here, as may compare with them; eſpecially upon the extreme Borders of the Learned part of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The number and nobleneſs of the Books doth much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the receptacle or place which containeth them, as
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57700:51"/> making no fair ſhew at the entrance, and ſomewhat want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing light. But as for the number and value of the Books, they are of opinion here that it yieldeth unto none, but rather excelleth any other Library in <hi>Europe.</hi> There was a place deſigned for the building of a fit receptacle for them; but, I know not how, a Theatre for Comedies is now built in that place.</p>
            <p>It is divided into eight Chambers or Rooms, which are ſo well filled, that many Books are fain to lye upon the Floor; and the Shelves ſtand ſo cloſe, that there is but juſt room to paſs between them. The Manuſcripts ſtand diſtinct from the printed Books, according to their Languages, being divided into ſix <hi>Claſſes, Theological, Juridical, Medical, Philoſophical, Hiſtorical, Philologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</hi> There can ſcarce be a more admirable Collection than the Manuſcripts in part of the firſt Chamber, of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, Syriack, Arabick, Turkiſh, Armenian, Aethiopick,</hi> and <hi>Chineſe</hi> Books.</p>
            <p>It was begun, at leaſt the Books began to be placed in this receptacle, by <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Firſt, but hath been much encreaſed by ſucceeding Emperours, moſt of them, ſince <hi>Rodolphus</hi> the Firſt, being much addicted unto Learning, there having been large acceſſions from many noble Libraries, and moſt upon the coſt of the Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours. The choiceſt Books in the famous Library of <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> of King <hi>Matthias Corvinus,</hi> Son unto <hi>Huniades,</hi> are now in it. The notable Library of <hi>Wolfgangus La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zius,</hi> who was Library-Keeper, was brought hither, and Three thouſand Books of <hi>Johannes Sambucus</hi> are now in this Repoſitory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Augerius Buſbequius,</hi> ſometime Library-Keeper hereof, added much unto it; and in his two <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Embaſſies procured great number of noble <hi>Greek</hi> Manuſcripts at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which are inſcribed with his own hand,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57700:52"/> 
               <hi>Aug. de Buſbeck. emit Conſtantinopoli.</hi> A great many were added from the Library of the Learned <hi>Johannes Cuſpini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus,</hi> Library Keeper, and Counſellor unto the Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. The notable Libraries and Mathematical Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Tycho Brahe, Kepler,</hi> and <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for it. But the largeſt acceſſion was made by the noble Library of Count <hi>Fugger,</hi> which conſiſting of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand Volumes, was purchaſed by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Third. Many were brought, ſome few years paſt, from the <hi>Ambraſian</hi> Library by <hi>Inſpruck,</hi> by the Learned <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus Lambecius,</hi> Library Keeper, Hiſtoriographer, and Counſellor unto the preſent Emperour; who hath alſo an excellent Library which is like to be added unto the <hi>Imperial.</hi> He then reckoned the Volumes in this great Library to amount at leaſt to Fourſcore thouſand; and by this time that number may be increaſed, for he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſome yearly. And the number might almoſt be endleſs, if they would make uſe of their priviledge, for the Emperour hath a right to have two Books of all that are printed in <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They have alſo a great advantage at <hi>Vienna,</hi> to acquire good <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> from the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Dominions, for the Emperour is obliged to have a Reſident with the Grand <hi>Signor</hi> whereſoever he moveth or ordereth him to be; even at the laſt ſight of St. <hi>Godart,</hi> the Emperour's Reſident was in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Camp. And when I was at <hi>Lariſſa</hi> in <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> the Reſident <hi>Signor di Caſa Nova,</hi> was inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive after Books to be found among the <hi>Greeks</hi> in Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries and other places. And this Emperour, like his Father, will ſpare no coſt toward ſuch Acquiries.</p>
            <p>By the eſpecial favour of my noble Friend <hi>Lambecius,</hi> I went many times into this Library, and he was ſo cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous as to let me have what Books I deſired unto my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Lodging: He would ſhew me divers Books upon
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57700:52"/> what Subject I required, and offered me a ſight of what Books he thought rare and eſtimable; and amongſt others I could not but take notice of theſe following.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Letter</hi> of the preſent Emperour of <hi>China,</hi> in the <hi>Chineſe</hi> and <hi>Tartarian</hi> Languages, unto the preſent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Germany,</hi> weaved in a very fine <hi>Roll.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Unto which magnificent Rarities there is one more added, the noble <hi>Chain</hi> of <hi>Pearl</hi> of eight yards long, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the <hi>Graff Tokoly</hi> in the late <hi>Hungarian</hi> war, as I underſtand ſince my Return.</p>
            <p>I went unto divers noted Places about <hi>Vienna:</hi> I walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the Hill of <hi>Vienna,</hi> two <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles diſtant from the Town, going up all the way by an eaſie Aſcent; from whence I had a proſpect of the City, and the Campagnia about it, together with the high Mountains in <hi>Steirmark</hi> covered with Snow: and in my return ſaw the Palace of the Empreſs Dowager without the Town, called <hi>la Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rita,</hi> and paſſed by the Convent of the <hi>Paulini.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About two <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles Eaſtward from <hi>Vienna,</hi> there is a very noble Garden-place belonging to the Emperour, built by <hi>Rodolphus</hi> the Second, which hath been formerly
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57700:56"/> well furniſhed, and provided with Plants, but now ſeems to be neglected, and ſomewhat ruinous. It conſiſteth of an inward and an outward ſquare Garden: The inward is two hundred ordinary paces ſquare, about the ſame big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with the Place Royal at <hi>Paris:</hi> It hath a <hi>Portico</hi> or <hi>Cloyſter,</hi> ſupported by Forty Pillars of white Stone on each ſide, and is covered with Copper; as are alſo the Pavilions which the common people think to be Gold. Beſides this, there is an handſome row of Buildings well ſeated, called <hi>Néw-gabaú,</hi> in which at preſent are many wild Beaſts kept. Lions and Tigres breed here, and have young ones. Some ſay this was the place of <hi>Solyman</hi> the Magnificents Tent when he beſieged <hi>Vienna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is alſo, about two or three miles from <hi>Vienna,</hi> a noted place of Devotion, called <hi>Arnols,</hi> much frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, eſpecially in <hi>Lent,</hi> divers carrying Croſſes very heavy all the way upon their ſhoulders. There is here a little Houſe built exactly after that of the Sepulchre at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and alſo a handſome Copy of the Picture of our Saviour and the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> with their exact heights. That of our Saviour is about two yards high; that of the bleſſed Virgin three or four ſingers breadth lower: Theſe are taken from the Original in St. <hi>John de Lateran</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> Hither the Empreſs deſired to go one morning from her own Palace on foot, out of Devotion, which ſhe perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though with a great deal of difficulty, ſhe being not uſed to walk, and the way was duſty. The Emperour accompanied her, and all the Court followed on foot, which made a handſome ſhew.</p>
            <p>Nearer unto <hi>Vienna</hi> there is alſo a remarkable place for Devotion, called <hi>Itzing:</hi> and in the way from <hi>Vienna</hi> unto it, the twelve Stations of the Croſs are marked out in imitation of what is obſerved near <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in the <hi>Via Crucis,</hi> or <hi>Doloroſa,</hi> in our Saviours proceeding from
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57700:57"/> the City unto Mount <hi>Calvary;</hi> the Figures thereof are printed, and the ſeveral paces between every Station ſet down. The Emperour hath a handſome Park near <hi>Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> called the <hi>Brater,</hi> wherein I beheld the effects of the great Lightning and Thunder which happened three days before, upon many great Trees which were torn, ſplit, or twiſted. There is a Houſe of Pleaſure in it, where among other things, I could not but take notice of a Muſical Inſtrument which I had not ſeen before, a <hi>Seat</hi> or <hi>Cheſt-drum;</hi> it hath a Cord like that of a <hi>Sea-trumpet,</hi> but ſoundeth like a <hi>Kettle-drum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I went alſo unto <hi>Laxambourg,</hi> whither the Emperour often retireth; he hath a Houſe in this place, but it is old, and not large. There is alſo a Houſe of Pleaſure in the Mote, into which there is no other paſſage but through a high <hi>Gorridore.</hi> The Caſtle is commodiouſly ſeated for the Emperours recreation; and there is an eight-ſquare Houſe in the <hi>Marſh,</hi> from which the Nobility and the Empreſs Dowager ſometimes uſed to ſhoot, ſhe being very expert therein. Over the Gate of the Emperours Houſe hangs a great Rib and Jaw-bone, whereof I could get no better account, then they were the Rib and Jaw-bone of a heathen-maid. They ſeemed to me to be Bones of an <hi>Elephant</hi> But many things that are old or obſcure, they call, in this Country, Heathen: as <hi>Roman</hi> Coyns, they call Heathen mony. And the Peaſants brought me, in a place which had been formerly an old <hi>Roman</hi> Station, part of the bit of a Bridle digged up, which they concluded to be a Heathen Key.</p>
            <p>From hence I went unto <hi>Mannerſdorff,</hi> ſeated not far from the River <hi>Leyta,</hi> where there is a natural <hi>hot Bath,</hi> called the <hi>Wildebath;</hi> it ariſeth under a Church, the Church being built over the Spring-head. The water of it is but Lukewarm, and therefore when they deſire it hotter, they boyl it, and ſo bathe in Tubs in a large room.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57700:57"/> From that Subſtance which ſticketh to the ſides of the Coppers in the boyling of it, they judge it to be impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with <hi>Sulphur, Salt-peter,</hi> and <hi>Chalk.</hi> The water colours the ſtones, and makes them look, when wet, like fine <hi>Turquoiſes.</hi> And the vapour of the Bath hanging up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Moſs on the ſides, gives it an Amber or Gold co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. The Phyſicians of <hi>Vienna</hi> have given a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count concerning the uſe of theſe Baths in <hi>High-dutch.</hi> Not far from hence is a noted Quarry of Stone, out of which a great part of <hi>Vienna</hi> is built. The Stones being large they cut and ſquare them at the Quarry.</p>
            <p>From hence I proceeded to the <hi>Newſidler-ſea</hi> or <hi>Lake,</hi> ſo called from <hi>Newſidle,</hi> which is a Town ſeated upon the Northern part of it, conſiſting of one ſtreet and ſome back-houſes, and a ſmall, ſquare, old Caſtle upon a Hill, from whence I had a good proſpect over the Lake. It is about three <hi>German</hi> miles broad, and ſeven miles long. The faireſt Lake in theſe parts, affording plenty of Fiſh; encompaſſed and thickly ſet about with ſmall Towns and Villages; and hath no River, at leaſt not conſiderable, running into or out of it. A little way from the Gate of <hi>Newſidle</hi> they dig out a black earth, out of which they make <hi>Salt peter.</hi> In this Journey, not far from <hi>Himburg,</hi> we paſſed by a place called <hi>Rauckward,</hi> which, though it ſeems not high, looks over a great part of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and as far as <hi>Brin,</hi> the ſecond City of <hi>Moravia,</hi> a part alſo of the Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and a part of the Kingdom of <hi>Hungaria.</hi> I went afterwards four <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles up the Stream of the <hi>Danube,</hi> to ſee a noted Quarry of Stone in a Hill called <hi>Altenburg.</hi> The beds, rows, or caſes of the Stones lye not horizontally, but rather elevated Northward, about the height of the Angle forty, yet are not always ſo regularly placed, but rather follow the ſhape of the Hill, and according to that are differently
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57700:58"/> ſituated. Here I alſo obſerved a Subſtance between a Clay and a Stone called <hi>Leberſtein,</hi> or <hi>Liverſtone;</hi> and upon many of theſe Stones I found the figures of Trees and Leaves, though not ſo deep or neat as upon the Stones by <hi>Florence;</hi> yet very prettily marked, and often with broader Leaves than I had elſewhere obſerved. I paſſed forward to <hi>Cloſter-Neuburg,</hi> a Town moſt of it belonging to that notable rich Monaſtery ſeated here, founded by St. <hi>Leopoldus</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and ſince much enriched by ſucceeding Donations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Matthaeus Merian</hi> hath a goodcut of the Proſpect of the <hi>Danube</hi> here abouts, and in what manner it paſſeth down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards between the two great Hills of <hi>Kalenburg</hi> and <hi>Biſn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg.</hi> Upon one Peak of <hi>Kalenburg</hi> live divers <hi>Camal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulenſes,</hi> of an Order the moſt ſevere of any, living moſt upon Roots and Herbs, in the manner of <hi>Hermites.</hi> Near their Cells they had paved the ground with thoſe Stones I mentioned, which were naturally marked with the ſhapes of Trees and Plants.</p>
            <p>After an open Autumn there followed a ſharp Winter at <hi>Vienna,</hi> in the months of <hi>December</hi> and <hi>January.</hi> The branches of the <hi>Danube</hi> were ſoon frozen over. The main Stream, by reaſon of its ſwift Current, held out longer, but was afterwards alſo frozen. Some have thought that this River is more apt to freez than others. And we read of Battels which have been fought upon this River frozen; but I could not make any regular Obſervation thereof. This hard weather the ground being covered with Snow, afforded handſome Recreations unto men, and ſome unto the Ladies, in running Courſes in handſome Sleds and Devices upon the Snow. Their Sleds were well contrived in the ſhape of <hi>Gryphins, Tigers, Swans, Scallop Shells, Dolphins, Peacocks,</hi> and the like Curioſities, carved, paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and gilded. The Lady ſits in one of theſe, richly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57700:58"/> in Velvet, lined with rich Furrs, ſet off with Lace and Jewels, in a Velvet Cap lined with Sables. The Sled is drawn by a Horſe, dreſſed up with Feathers of all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and Bells hanging about him, a pair of Stags horns behind his head, Ribbons and other Ornaments: one or more Pages ride by on Horſe-back with Torches in their hands. And after this manner they perform their Courſe upon the frozen Snow about the ſtreets of <hi>Vienna</hi> in the night, with good ſpeed one after another. A Gentleman ſits behind the Lady and guides the Horſe. But the Froſt breaking up put an end to theſe Recreations. The Froſt began and ended here the ſame day that it began and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Feſtivity of <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> was obſerved much after the ſame Manner, Ceremonies, and Solemnities as in <hi>Italy.</hi> On <hi>Chriſtmas-day</hi> the Emperour dined publickly, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with many Nobles and great Perſons, and three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable low Dwarfs. Upon St. <hi>Stephens-day</hi> he went to the Cathedral of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and went up to the Altar, kneeled, and kiſſed the Plate whereon the <hi>Hoſtia</hi> had lain. At the <hi>Epiphany</hi> or <hi>Twelfth-tide,</hi> the old cuſtome of choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing King and Queen was obſerved at Court. Count <hi>Leſley</hi> happened to be King, the Emperour laid the Cloath, and the Empreſs filled out Wine, together with other old Cuſtomes.</p>
            <p>Before <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> there was extraordinary mirth and jollity at the Court upon occaſion of a Marriage: For Count <hi>Serau,</hi> Governour of <hi>Gratz</hi> in <hi>Styria,</hi> married a natural Daughter of <hi>Philip</hi> the Fourth, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> which was obſerved with many noble Solemnities and Bravery. And the Nobility and Ladies were ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially ſplendid, that I was much ſurpriſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at.</p>
            <pb n="106" facs="tcp:57700:59"/>
            <p>This was followed by a Funeral Solemnity for the Count of <hi>Draun,</hi> who was Colonel of the Forces in <hi>Vienna,</hi> and who had one of the nobleſt Houſes in the City; his Corps was brought out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and interred in the <hi>Dominican</hi> Church, where he formerly built a very fair Altar, there was raiſed for him a <hi>Caſtrum Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loris,</hi> handſomely contrived and ſet round with white Wax Torches and Candles.</p>
            <p>While I was in <hi>Vienna,</hi> the Empreſs <hi>Margarita</hi> was delivered of a Daughter, which was Chriſtned by the Name of <hi>Maria, Antonina, Joſepha, Benedicta, Roſalia, Petronella,</hi> but ſhe lived not many months. When the Empreſs came abroad, ſhe brought the Child to the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtines</hi> Church, where Cardinal <hi>Carlo Caraffa,</hi> the Pope's Nuncio, received it, bleſſed it, and laid it upon the Altar.</p>
            <p>During my ſtay here, the Election was in readineſs for a King of <hi>Poland,</hi> after the voluntary reſignation of that Crown by King <hi>Caſimir;</hi> and Couriers often paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that Country and this. There were Competitors the <hi>Czar</hi> of <hi>Muſcovy</hi>'s Son, the Duke of <hi>Newburg,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> moved actively for the Duke of <hi>Newburg,</hi> the Emperour for the Prince of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who was then at <hi>Vienna,</hi> in great favour with the Emperour, who greatly promoted his intereſt; a Perſon of great eſteem, and who, if General <hi>Lubomirski</hi> had been living, who was his intimate Friend, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability might have obtained the Crown; and thereupon it was conceived that he ſhould have married the Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Siſter. But the <hi>Poles</hi> made choice of one of their own Country, who was no Competitor, <hi>Michael Wiſno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witski,</hi> lately deceaſed, who alſo married the Siſter of the Emperour.</p>
            <pb n="107" facs="tcp:57700:59"/>
            <p>When I was here, there were many Ambaſſadours of Note, <hi>Don Balthaſar de la Cueva,</hi> Marquiſs of <hi>Malagon,</hi> and brother to the Viceroy of <hi>Naples,</hi> was Ambaſſadour for <hi>Spain.</hi> Cardinal <hi>Carlo Caraffa</hi> was the Pope's Nuncio. The <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſadour Extraordinary, ſolicited for aſſiſtance for <hi>Candia,</hi> and he obtained the Regiment of <hi>Porcia</hi> under Marquiſs <hi>Pio.</hi> Count <hi>Souches</hi> the younger, who was Governour of <hi>Leopoldſtadt,</hi> and many noble and valiant Souldiers were preparing for that Expedition. The <hi>Turks</hi> gave aſſurance of the <hi>Grand Signor</hi>'s intention to maintain the Peace inviolably; and requeſted the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour not to aſſiſt the <hi>Venetians</hi> or <hi>Tranſilvanians,</hi> nor to promote, but rather hinder, the Election of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Muſcovy</hi>'s Son to the Crown of <hi>Poland.</hi> The Biſhop of <hi>Beziers,</hi> ſent by the King of <hi>France</hi> to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> came not hither, but paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through <hi>Nurenburg,</hi> where I lodged at the ſame Inn: They were generally here againſt the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, and ſo were a great part of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Nobility. An Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour came alſo from the <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartary,</hi> to confirm a Peace, and afford mutual Aſſiſtance upon occaſion. <hi>Cha Gagi Aga</hi> was the Ambaſſadour, who brought a Preſent of the beſt <hi>Tartarian</hi> Horſes, which are of high eſteem for ſwiftneſs, hardineſs, boldneſs in paſſing frozen Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and taking and ſwimming over great Streams. He was diſmiſſed with noble Preſents of Plate. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour preſented the <hi>Cham</hi> of Tartary with a fair Silver Baſon and Ewer, and a curious Watch; and ſent Preſents unto the <hi>Chammine</hi> his Wife,; and alſo to his Siſter and four Brothers. His Followers were ſtout men, of good ſtature, courſe Complexions, wearing long furr'd Veſts and Calpack's, or furr'd Caps. Some of them had ſilver Rings with the ſame Signatures of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Seales. They took much Tobacco in very long Pipes. Their
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57700:60"/> Tobacco is not in Rolls, but in Leaves, and dry. They went about wandring and gazing at moſt things, as Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Houſes, Shops: And took much delight to be in the Fair, where they would take much notice of ſmall trifles. Yet theſe are the men that make ſuch ſad Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions into the Eaſtern parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and carrying away ſo many thouſands, ſell them to the <hi>Turks,</hi> and ſo repair the defect of People in <hi>Turky.</hi> And now after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of men in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the Country about by the Plague, are like to be active in that Trade, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to find better Markets for their Plagiaries and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations.</p>
            <p>There are divers <hi>Greeks</hi> who trade to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny live in the Town, among which I met with three con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable perſons. One a grave Abbot, who was forced from his Convent by the <hi>Turk,</hi> upon ſuſpicion that he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponded with thoſe of <hi>Candia.</hi> Another who went by the name of <hi>Conſtantinus Catacuzenos,</hi> and was of the Blood Royal of the <hi>Catacuzeni.</hi> The third was <hi>Jeremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> a <hi>Greek</hi> Prieſt, who had travelled through <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> and from thence through the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and intended for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople.</hi> He came into <hi>England</hi> to enquire after a young man who was in a Ship which was firſt taken by an <hi>Algerine,</hi> and afterwards by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man of war in the <hi>Levant.</hi> He was very kindly uſed in <hi>England,</hi> and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly at <hi>Cambridge.</hi> He did a great deal of honour at <hi>Vienna</hi> unto the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, declaring that they were the moſt civil, generous, and learned people he had met with in all his Travels, and that he no where found ſo many who could ſpeak or underſtand <hi>Greek,</hi> or who gave him ſo good ſatisfaction in all parts of Knowledge: And as a teſtimony of his reſpect and gratitude, requeſted me to encloſe a <hi>Greek</hi> Letter unto Dr. <hi>Pierſon,</hi> now Lord
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57700:60"/> Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Barrow,</hi> now Maſter of <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity Colledge</hi> in <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moſt men live here plentifully, there being abundance of all proviſion. They have great quantity of Corn, which upon Scarcity, by the help of the <hi>Danube,</hi> might be brought unto them from remoter parts. The Country affordeth ſuch plenty of wine, that they ſend a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable quantity up the River. They have alſo rich wines out of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſuch variety, that there are more than thirty ſeveral ſorts of Wine to be ſold in <hi>Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi> They are not alſo without good Beer. <hi>Halſtadt</hi> in <hi>Auſtria</hi> affordeth them Salt, where they make it by letting in water into the hollow parts of a Mountain, where it drinketh in the Salt of the Earth, and is afterwards let out and boiled up. This affordeth great profit to the Emperor, and therefore the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Salt is not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be brought higher than <hi>Preſburg.</hi> They have alſo plenty of Sheep and Oxen; but for Oxen at preſent they are alſo ſupplied from <hi>Hungary,</hi> nor only from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries in the Emperours Dominions, but from the Turkiſh parts, by permiſſion of the <hi>Grand Signor;</hi> and they are brought hither by the Eaſtern Company of <hi>Vienna.</hi> They eat much wild Boar, whereof the Fat is delicious, like that of Veniſon with us. They want not Hares, Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets, Partridges, Pheaſants. A Fowl called <hi>Haſenhendal,</hi> or <hi>Gallina Corylorum,</hi> is much eſteemed by them, which made me the more wonder to meet with ſome odde diſhes at their Tables; as <hi>Guiny-pigs,</hi> divers ſorts of <hi>Snails,</hi> and <hi>Tortoiſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Danube,</hi> and many Rivers which run into it, afford them plenty of Fiſh, extraordinary <hi>Carps, Trouts, Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Pikes, Eels,</hi> ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Lampries,</hi> and many Fiſhes finely coloured; the white Fiſh, <hi>Creviſes</hi> very large; the beſt come out of the River <hi>Swechet,</hi> not far
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57700:61"/> from <hi>Vienna.</hi> They have alſo that ſubſtantial large fiſh, called a <hi>Scheiden,</hi> or <hi>Silurus Geſneri,</hi> larger than <hi>Pike, Salmon,</hi> or any of our River Fiſhes; but the great Fiſhes called <hi>Hauſons,</hi> or <hi>Huſones,</hi> in <hi>Johnſtonus,</hi> for largeneſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all others; ſome being twenty foot long. Some think this to be the ſame Fiſh which <hi>Aelian</hi> nameth <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacetus,</hi> and ſpeaketh largely of the fiſhing for them in <hi>Iſter.</hi> I was at the fiſhing places for <hi>Hauſons</hi> in <hi>Schut</hi> Iſland, between <hi>Preſburg</hi> and <hi>Komara,</hi> for they come not uſually higher, eſpecially in ſhoals; and it is much that they come ſo high, for they are conceived to come out of the <hi>Euxine-ſea,</hi> and ſo up the ſtream. They eat them both freſh and ſalted; they taſte moſt like <hi>Sturgeon.</hi> It is a Cartilagineous Fiſh, conſiſting of griſtles, and they have a hollow nervous chord all down the back, which being dried ſerveth for a whip. When they fiſh for them they blow a Horn or Trumpet, and know where they go by the moving of the water. From <hi>Venice</hi> they are ſupplied with Oyſters, with ſalt <hi>Sturgeon,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with red <hi>Herrings,</hi> and great variety of other Fiſhes pickled up: as alſo with <hi>Oranges, Limons,</hi> and other Fruits. Obſerving much freedom, muſick, and jollity in the City. I wondered how they could content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without Plays, for there were few while I was there, till the Players came hither out of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted here for a time. The Jeſuites would ſometimes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the Emperour and Empreſs with a Comedy at their Colledge; and I had once the favour to be at one when they were preſent.</p>

            <p>In Treaſon and high Crimes they cut off the right Hand of the Malefactor, and his Head immediately after. I ſaw a Woman beheaded ſitting in a Chair, the Executioner ſtriking off her Head with a Fore-blow, ſhe behaved her ſelf well, and was accompanied unto the Market place by the <hi>Confraternity</hi> of the <hi>Dead,</hi> who have a charitable care of ſuch Perſons, and are not of any Religious Order, but <hi>Lay men,</hi> among whom alſo in this place there are many Fraternities and Orders; as of the <hi>Holy Virgin,</hi> of the <hi>Holy Croſs</hi> and others. Another perſon alſo executed after the ſame manner; as ſoon as his Head fell to the ground, while the Body was in the Chair, a man ran ſpeedily with a Pot in his hand, and filling it with the Blood yet ſpouting out of his Neck, he preſently drank it off, and ran away; and this he did as a Remedy againſt the <hi>Falling Sickneſs.</hi> I have read of ſome who have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the ſame Medicine; and heard of others who have done the like in <hi>Germany.</hi> And <hi>Gelſus</hi> takes notice, that in his time ſome Epileptical perſons did drink the Blood of the <hi>Gladiatours.</hi> But many Phyſicians have, in all times, abominated that Medicine. Nor did I ſtay after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſo long as to know the effect thereof, as to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended cure. But moſt men looked upon it as of great uncertainty: and of all men the Jews, who ſuffer no Blood to come into their Lips, muſt moſt diſlike it.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Preſburg</hi> they have a ſtrange way of Execution, ſtill uſed at <hi>Metz,</hi> and ſome other places, by a Maid, or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine like a Maid finely dreſſed up with her hands before her. The Malefactor ſalutes her firſt, and then retireth. But at his ſecond ſalute ſhe openeth her hands and cuts his Heart in ſunder.</p>
            <pb n="112" facs="tcp:57700:64"/>
            <p>Though the Winter was ſharp, yet the advantage of Stoves, and lying between two Feather-beds, made it tolerable: For they uſe Stoves here as in other parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> where they lodge and eat in Stoves; and great Perſons have Stoves in the Church, or ſuch as look into the Church. There are Stoves alſo in the publick Schools where Lectures are read. And this way of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between two Feather-beds, with a neat laced ſheet ſpread over, is more convenient in a cold Country, than moſt others they make uſe of. For in the common Inns in <hi>Germany</hi> they generally ſleep upon Straw, and alſo in <hi>Hungary</hi> almoſt every where; and more Eaſterly upon the ground, ſpreading a Carpet or Saddle-cloath under them: and more Northerly they content themſelves with the Skins of Beaſts, <hi>Bears, Elks,</hi> or the like; upon which they ſleep in the night. Thoſe that ſleep loweſt are cooleſt in a Stove; thoſe that lye upon Tables, Benches, or higher, are more expoſed to the heat. The Citizens of <hi>Vienna</hi> are well attired, and uſe Furs very much. The Women wear a high Velvet Bonnet, lined or faced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. The Place ſeemed to be healthful; but they ſpeak much of the <hi>Colica Auſtriaca,</hi> as an Endemial and Local Diſeaſe, very hardly yielding unto good <hi>Medicines.</hi> They ſpeak good <hi>German</hi> at the Court and in the City; but the Common and Country people ſeemed to ſpeak grumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and beſides their accent, have divers words different from other parts.</p>
            <p>They have a Cuſtome upon St. <hi>Nicholas-day</hi> to put ſome ſmall Gift into the Childrens ſhoes; among other things they put in Medals and Dollars made of paper and flower gilded and ſilvered over, yet ſcarce worth a penny. They ſell <hi>Trochies</hi> or <hi>Tablets</hi> in the Markets, made of the pulpe of the Fruit of <hi>Hip-briar,</hi> made ſharp with <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi> very refreſhing. Some carry about them a <hi>Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,</hi>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:57700:64"/> as a defence againſt Thunder: and they rub their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Gums with a <hi>Wolfs</hi> tooth inſtead of <hi>Coral.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I was at <hi>Venice</hi> in the time of the <hi>Carnival,</hi> I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved many Recreations and Shews, as Rope-dancing, flying down the Rope, cutting off Bulls-necks with Swords, and many other. But at <hi>Vienna</hi> a notable trick which I ſaw there pleaſed me much: A man of a middle Stature laid down upon his back, and a heavy Anvil was placed upon his Breaſt, as much as two men could well lift, then two other men with great Hammers laid on, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they had given almoſt an hundred blows, and cut in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a great Horſhoe of iron, about half an inch thick.</p>
            <p>Here is no Chriſtian Religion publickly permitted but the <hi>Roman,</hi> and therefore thoſe of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion</hi> are fain to reſort unto <hi>Preſburg,</hi> Forty miles off, for which they have ſome convenience by the <hi>Danube,</hi> and a <hi>Coach</hi> which goeth every day. In the time of <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Second, they were permitted the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their Religion in the Church of the <hi>Holy Croſs,</hi> in the City of <hi>Vienna.</hi> But afterwards were prohibited by <hi>Rodolphus</hi> the Second. The Emperour <hi>Matthias</hi> gave them permiſſion to meet at <hi>Hernals,</hi> a little more than an <hi>Engliſh</hi> mile from <hi>Vienna;</hi> and gave leave to their <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> to come into the City, and there to <hi>chriſten, marry, baptize,</hi> and <hi>viſit</hi> the <hi>ſick.</hi> From which time they encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed very much, till <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Second, returning from the Battel of <hi>Prague,</hi> baniſhed their <hi>Miniſter</hi> from <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna</hi> and <hi>Arnols;</hi> ſent the <hi>Freyherr Jorger,</hi> to whom the Caſtle of <hi>Arnolds</hi> belonged, Priſoner unto <hi>Lintz;</hi> and never gave over till he had taken away their Priviledges and Freedom of meeting publickly in any part of <hi>lower Auſtria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here are no ſmall number of <hi>Jews,</hi> who have a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Habitation aſſigned them over the Water. They have
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57700:65"/> alſo a Street allowed them in the City for the day time, but they muſt all depart at night beyond the River into the Suburbs.</p>
            <p>They are much diſtaſted by the Citizens and Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the Scholars agree but ill with them. While I was at <hi>Vienna</hi> there was a quarrel between them to an high degree. For the <hi>Scholars</hi> aſſaulted the <hi>Jews</hi> Town, beat, wounded, and threw divers of them into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Divers <hi>Scholars</hi> were wounded, ſome killed, and alſo ſome Souldiers who were commanded out to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Fray: and the <hi>Jews</hi> Town was guarded many days by the Souldiers of the City. This begot ſuch ill Blood and Complaints; that a good number of the <hi>Jews</hi> were to be baniſhed at a certain day. The <hi>Jews,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate with the Empreſs, then with Child, preſented her with a noble <hi>Silver Cradle,</hi> but ſhe would not receive it. And there was great danger of the general baniſhment of them when I left that City, which was afterwards effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, they being ſeverely prohibited from living, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at <hi>Vienna,</hi> but in any part of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> where there were formerly whole Villages of them, ſo as they were forced to betake themſelves into the Dominions of the <hi>Turk,</hi> unto <hi>Venice,</hi> into <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Bohemia.</hi> They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not permitted to dwell in the Neighbour Countries of <hi>Hungary</hi> ſubject to the Emperour, <hi>Styria,</hi> or <hi>Carinthia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs they ſeemed uſeful unto the place for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy accommodation of any thing, either by ſale or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, but the people looked with an evil eye upon them, as taking away much of their Trade and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They alſo looked upon them as uſeleſs in war for defence of the place; and were not without ſome jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie that they held correſpondence with the <hi>Turks,</hi> and gave Intelligence of their Affairs unto them. Yet the Souldiery dealt much with them, and Captains for the ſuddain ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57700:65"/> furniſhing, and accommodating of their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. And dining one day with a Commander at a <hi>Jews</hi> Houſe, amongſt other Diſcourſe I asked the <hi>Jew</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>ten Tribes,</hi> and where they were? He ſaid <hi>they were far off in</hi> Aſia, <hi>beyond a great Lake which was continually ſtormy, and ſcarce paſſable, but upon their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day, upon which days the Jews do not willingly travel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have ſeen their <hi>Circumciſion</hi> at <hi>Rome, Padua,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts. Their <hi>Phyſicians</hi> ordinarily profeſs great skill in <hi>Urines;</hi> and the common people reſort unto them rather than unto <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and are ſo credulous, and have ſuch an opinion of them, that they might be made to believe they have ſome old <hi>Receipts</hi> of King <hi>Solomon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are many <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> yet they ſeem to me to be in greater numbers in <hi>Germany.</hi> In <hi>Amſterdam</hi> they are alſo grown very numerous. At <hi>Franckfurt</hi> they told me there were ſeven thouſand of them, which ſeemed ſcarce credible. At <hi>Colen</hi> they are in great numbers: at <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> not a few. But the greateſt number ſurely is in <hi>Prague.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though they be permitted in many Countries, yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>Chriſtian Princes</hi> and <hi>States</hi> have aſſigned them ſome mark in their <hi>Habits,</hi> to diſtinguiſh them. In <hi>Avignon</hi> their <hi>Hats</hi> are <hi>yellow.</hi> In <hi>Italy</hi> their <hi>Hats</hi> are covered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with <hi>Taffate.</hi> In <hi>Germany</hi> they wear <hi>Ruffs</hi> and <hi>Gowns</hi> with great <hi>Capes.</hi> In <hi>Holland</hi> I obſerved no diſtinction. But the <hi>Jews</hi> there, moſt of them having come out of <hi>Portugal,</hi> there may be ſome ſuſpicion of them from their Complexion.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, when I conſider the old ſtrength of <hi>Vienna,</hi> conſiſting in an old <hi>wall</hi> and a deep <hi>ditch,</hi> I cannot much wonder that <hi>Matthias Corvinus,</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> took this City. And I muſt aſcribe it, under God, unto the ſingular valour and reſolution of the Defendants, that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57700:66"/> 
               <hi>Solyman</hi> the Magnificent, with two hundred thouſand men, was not able to take it, and though he made large brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, could never enter it, but loſt ſome thouſands at an Aſſault, and departed at laſt with the loſs of a great part of his Army. But this place is now in a far better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſtrongly fortified, and able to reſiſt the greateſt Forces of <hi>Turky.</hi> The <hi>houſes</hi> are cleared from the <hi>wall;</hi> and yet for better ſecurity, when I was there, Count <hi>Souches</hi> adviſed the Emperour to pull down part of the <hi>Suburbs</hi> upon the other ſide of the neareſt branch of the <hi>Danube,</hi> leſt the <hi>Turks</hi> might take advantage to play up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the two <hi>Baſtions</hi> on that ſide.</p>
            <p>It would be a ſad loſs for <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> if this place were in the hands of the <hi>Turk;</hi> and no man knows where he would reſt. If he ſhould begin with this place, and take it, the ſtrong holds of <hi>Rab, Komara,</hi> and <hi>Leopold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtadt</hi> would want their ſupport, and ſoon fall into his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; and if he were Lord of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> a great part of <hi>Germany</hi> would lye bare unto him: and probably it would not be long before he viſited <hi>Italy,</hi> into which Country he would then find other ways than by <hi>Palma nova.</hi>

            <p>From thence we paſſed by <hi>Ulverskirken, Paulitz,</hi> and <hi>Moravian Budweiſſe</hi> to <hi>Zimmaw,</hi> and by <hi>Byrnitz</hi> came to <hi>Igla,</hi> or <hi>Iglau,</hi> upon the River <hi>Igla,</hi> which at laſt run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth into the great River <hi>Marck,</hi> a very pleaſant place, ſeated upon a Hill, on the Frontiers of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> It is well fortified <hi>à la moderna,</hi> upon one ſide, and hath one of the largeſt <hi>Piazza</hi>'s that I have ſeen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moravia,</hi> is a pleaſant and fruitful Country affording plenty of neceſſaries for life; the people are plain-dealing, ſtout, and make good Souldiers. It is commodiouſly furniſhed with Rivers, the greateſt whereof is the <hi>Mora</hi> or <hi>Marck,</hi> which ariſing in the Northern part thereof, runneth quite through the Country, and entreth the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naw</hi> not far from <hi>Preſburg.</hi> The other conſiderable Streams are the <hi>Theya</hi> or <hi>Thaiſa,</hi> the <hi>Swarta,</hi> the <hi>Schwitta,</hi> which run into the <hi>Marck.</hi> In the laſt <hi>Turkiſh</hi> wars the <hi>Tartars</hi> having paſſed the <hi>Wag</hi> in <hi>Hungaria,</hi> made incurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into <hi>Moravia,</hi> and carried away ſome thouſands of the Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>Leaving <hi>Igla,</hi> we ſoon came into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> firſt coming into <hi>Stecken,</hi> then to <hi>Teutchin Broda</hi> by the River <hi>Sac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zua,</hi> formerly a ſtrong place, taken by <hi>Ziſca</hi> the famous <hi>Bohemian General,</hi> who then forced the Emperour <hi>Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> to fly out of <hi>Bohemia</hi> by the way of <hi>Igla.</hi> From
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57700:68"/> thence we came to <hi>Heberne,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Janikaw:</hi> At this place, upon the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> 1643. was fought that memorable Battel between the <hi>Swedes,</hi> commanded by <hi>Leonard Torſtenſon,</hi> and the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> under Count <hi>Hatzfield, Goetz,</hi> and other <hi>Commanders.</hi> The <hi>Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts</hi> had the better at firſt; but falling upon the Enemies Baggage, and being too greedy of Booty, they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, three thouſand ſlain, four thouſand taken priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, with their General <hi>Hatzfield,</hi> and ſix or ſeven Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels. The ſucceſs hereof gave the <hi>Swedes</hi> advantage to proceed further, and into <hi>Sileſia</hi> and <hi>Auſtria.</hi> In this Town meeting with a Gentleman who came from <hi>Schaclitz,</hi> which is not far from the <hi>Riſgeburg,</hi> or <hi>Mountain of Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,</hi> about the Head of the River <hi>Elbe,</hi> I enquired of him concerning the ſpirit <hi>Ribenſal,</hi> which is ſaid to infeſt that Country, but he could ſay nothing therein of his own knowledge; and though he was confident that there was ſuch a Spirit, yet he confeſſed that for twelve years it had done no hurt. In <hi>Hills, Mountains,</hi> and places of <hi>Mines</hi> ſuch reports are ordinary. It is reported that a Spirit haunts the <hi>Silver Mines</hi> of <hi>Brunſwick:</hi> And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be in the <hi>Tinn Mine</hi> of <hi>Slackenwalde</hi> in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and to walk in the ſhape of a <hi>Monk,</hi> who ſtrikes the <hi>Miners,</hi> ſings and plays on the <hi>Bag-pipes,</hi> and doth many ſuch Tricks. And <hi>Agricola</hi> in the latter end of his Sixth Book <hi>Dere Metallica,</hi> gives this for one reaſon why <hi>Mines,</hi> or <hi>paſſages</hi> in <hi>Mines,</hi> are given over.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Janikaw</hi> I travelled to <hi>Czaſlaw,</hi> a good Town, and the chiefeſt in the <hi>Czaſlawer</hi> Circle: In this place they ſay that <hi>Ziſca</hi> was buried, that famous <hi>Bohemian Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral;</hi> he loſt one Eye by an <hi>Arrow,</hi> and was at length blind of both, yet gave not over the war, and proved ſucceſsful in it. He wiſhed his <hi>Friends</hi> to make a <hi>Drum</hi> of his <hi>Skin,</hi> which ſhould ſerve to fright away their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57700:68"/> And though he cared not for any Sepulchral Monument, yet he had one in this place.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Czaſlaw</hi> we came to <hi>Guttenberg,</hi> or <hi>Cottenberg,</hi> about eight <hi>Bohemian</hi> miles from <hi>Prague,</hi> every mile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing five or ſix <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles. A large Town, and much frequented, not far from the River <hi>Albis</hi> or <hi>Elbe,</hi> of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecal note for the <hi>Silver Mines</hi> about it: The <hi>Hills</hi> near it are not high, and conſequently the Mines are not ſo deep as thoſe of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and ſome others in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi> yet ſome are above ſeventy or eighty <hi>Fathoms.</hi> They have wrought at theſe <hi>Mines</hi> ſeven hundred years, and there are about thirty of them. I went down into that which was firſt digged, but afterwards left for a long time, but they work there now again, it is called the <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> or <hi>Auf der Cotten,</hi> upon the <hi>Cotten,</hi> or <hi>Coat-hill;</hi> and as the Story goeth, a <hi>Monk</hi> walking over this Hill found a kind of a <hi>Silver Tree</hi> ſticking to his Garment, which was the occaſion that they afterwards digged and built theſe <hi>Mines,</hi> and the place retains the name of <hi>Cotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Mine</hi> into which I deſcended near the Town, is but nineteen <hi>Fathoms</hi> deep; the chief <hi>Vein</hi> of the <hi>Ore</hi> runneth South, and is about a foot in breadth: the <hi>Ore</hi> holdeth or containeth in it <hi>Silver</hi> and <hi>Copper,</hi> ſo that out of an hundred pound weight of <hi>Ore,</hi> they ordinarily get an Ounce of <hi>Silver,</hi> and eight, nine, or ten ounces or more of <hi>Copper,</hi> even to pounds, but it is not well known, for the <hi>Copper-works</hi> are the Emperours. The <hi>Undertakers</hi> get out what <hi>Silver</hi> they can, and afterwards ſell the <hi>Ore</hi> unto the Emperours Officers; but ſome <hi>Ore</hi> is ſorich as to contain eight or nine ounces of <hi>Silver.</hi> A blew <hi>Earth</hi> which they meet with in digging, affords the beſt hopes of <hi>Ore.</hi> Two men lately periſhed in this <hi>Mine,</hi> having made a fire in it, being either choaked with the ſmoak, or,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57700:69"/> as they thought, by the poyſonous exhalations forced out of the Minerals by the fire. I have read that <hi>Libuſſa</hi> the Princeſs, and reputed Sorcereſs of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> foretold many things concerning theſe <hi>Mines;</hi> but certain it is, that for the advantage and profit theſe bring, the Town hath ſuffered much in many wars. The Emperour <hi>Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> made haſte out of it upon the approach of <hi>Ziſca,</hi> and ſeeing he could not hold it, burnt the Town; but it was ſoon rebuilt and poſſeſſed by <hi>Ziſca,</hi> whoſe party called it the <hi>Purſe of Antichriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Leaving <hi>Cottenburg,</hi> I came to <hi>Colline</hi> and to <hi>Bohemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Broda,</hi> ſo named to diſtinguiſh it from <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>Teu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick Broda</hi> before mentioned, a conſiderable good Town, and from thence came to <hi>Prag,</hi> or <hi>Prague,</hi> the Capital and Royal City of the Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> The <hi>Walls</hi> of this City ſeem to encloſe the greateſt Citcuit of ground of any I have ſeen in <hi>Germany,</hi> but the Hills and void ſpaces within it take up a large Tract, and therein it is like the City of <hi>Lyon</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> it is ſeated upon the River <hi>Muldau,</hi> by the <hi>Bohemians</hi> named <hi>Ultaue,</hi> a large rapid River, ariſing in the South part of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and before at arriveth at <hi>Prague,</hi> receiveth the River <hi>Sarſua</hi> and the <hi>Watta</hi> into it; and Northward of <hi>Prague</hi> the River <hi>Egra,</hi> and joyneth with the <hi>Elbe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This great place conſiſteth of three Towns, named the <hi>Old,</hi> the <hi>New,</hi> and the <hi>Kleine Seitten,</hi> or <hi>leſſer Town.</hi> The <hi>old Town</hi> lieth upon the Eaſt of the River <hi>Muldau,</hi> is very populous, full of Buildings, private and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. Very conſiderable in this part is alſo the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wherein are great numbers of Students and Scholars, there being but one Univerſity in <hi>Bohemia;</hi> many perſons alſo reſorting thither from other Countries. It is ſcarce credible what is reported of the number of Scholars in <hi>Prague</hi> in former Ages, as hath been delivered by divers
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57700:69"/> Authors. And <hi>Lewis du May,</hi> Counſellor unto the Duke of <hi>Wittenburg,</hi> affirmeth, That there are at preſent ſcarce ſo many Students in all <hi>Germany,</hi> as there were at <hi>Prague</hi> in the year 1409. when they reckoned above Forty thouſand under the <hi>Rectorſhip</hi> of <hi>John Hus. Charles</hi> the Fourth, Emperour, and King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> founded the <hi>Univerſity</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> giving equal priviledges to the <hi>Bohemians, Polanders,</hi> and <hi>Germans:</hi> and when he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench his favours towards Strangers, there went out of the Town in a weeks time twenty four thouſand Scholars, and a little after, ſixteen thouſand, whereby we may judge there were more Scholars in <hi>Prague</hi> than other perſons in ſome great Cities. There are alſo in this <hi>old Town</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>Colledges</hi> and <hi>Cloyſters.</hi> The <hi>Jeſuites</hi> have a fair, handſome <hi>Colledge,</hi> near unto the <hi>Bridge,</hi> but the <hi>Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> of the <hi>old Town</hi> are inferiour to thoſe of the <hi>leſſer Town.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>new Town</hi> is large, and together with the River, encompaſſeth the <hi>old,</hi> and is divided from it by a large <hi>Trench</hi> or <hi>Ditch,</hi> in o which they can let in the River. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> have a <hi>Cloyſter</hi> of <hi>Franciſcans</hi> near unto an old <hi>Tower</hi> in the <hi>Wall</hi> of the <hi>old Town.</hi> The <hi>Jeſuites</hi> have alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun a large <hi>Cloyſter,</hi> which, if finiſhed according to its beginning and deſign, will be very ſpacious and noble. They are now making <hi>Baſtions</hi> about the <hi>Town</hi> at one end thereof; there is alſo a <hi>Citadel,</hi> but not finiſhed, at <hi>Wiſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raht,</hi> or <hi>Wiſſegrade,</hi> formerly the Seat of the Princes of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and alſo of the famous Princeſs <hi>Libuſſa,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Crocus,</hi> and Wife unto <hi>Primiſlaus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Kleine Seitten,</hi> or <hi>leſſer Prague,</hi> far exceedeth the other for pleaſantneſs and beauty of Buildings and fair Palaces. This part lieth Weſtward of the River <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daw,</hi> which between this and the <hi>old Town,</hi> is paſſable by a ſtrong <hi>Stone-bridge,</hi> conſiſting of ſixteen great Arches,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57700:70"/> being about Seventeen hundred foot long, and Thirty five foot broad, and two open Gates under two high Towers of Stone at each end. A great part of this Town lieth high, and upon the Hill ſtandeth <hi>Hratſchin,</hi> or <hi>Upper Prague,</hi> and a Summer Houſe of the Emperours, beſides a Magnificent Palace of the Emperours, as King of <hi>Bohemia;</hi> and by it a fair <hi>Cathedral Church</hi> dedicated to St. <hi>Veit,</hi> firſt built by St. <hi>Wenceſlaus,</hi> Duke of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> 923. from whence the Town and River is beſt viewed. In this Church are divers <hi>old Monuments</hi> for great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; as for <hi>Pogiebrachius</hi> a <hi>Bohemian</hi> King, <hi>Wenceſlaus, Rodolphus</hi> the Second, <hi>Charles</hi> the Fourth, <hi>Ladiſlaus, Maximilian</hi> the Second, and other <hi>Arch-Dukes</hi> and <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours.</hi> There are alſo many Houſes of the <hi>Nobility</hi> in this part of the City. The Palace and Garden of <hi>Colare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> is exceeding neat, though ſmall. But I was moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the Palace of Count <hi>Wallenſteyn,</hi> Duke of <hi>Fried<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> General unto the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Second, who being ſuſpected to Uſurp that Kingdom, was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards killed at <hi>Egra.</hi> This Palace was built upon the Ruins of an hundred Houſes, purpoſely plucked down to make room for it; wherein the Hall is large, the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den handſome; upon one ſide whereof there is a place to manage Horſes, and near unto it a Fiſh-pond: in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part there is a noble <hi>Aviary</hi> with a Garden and Trees in it, after the manner of the <hi>Aviary</hi> of Prince <hi>Doria</hi> at <hi>Genoa,</hi> which is eighty paces long, and eighteen broad. The Stable is large, and worth the ſeeing, wherein there is a <hi>Marble Pillar</hi> between each Horſe, and for every Horſe there is placed in a nich of the Wall a Rack of Steel, and Manger of Marble, and over his Head hangeth a Picture of the Horſe, as big as the Life, with his Name under it. Among the reſt, I obſerved that a Bay-horſe had for his Name <hi>Monte d'Oro,</hi> a Mare, <hi>Bella donna,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57700:70"/> 
               <hi>Eſpagnoletta,</hi> and his moſt beloved Horſe was named <hi>Mas Querido.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some have thought that the beſt <hi>high German</hi> is ſpoken in this part of <hi>Prague;</hi> and there living ſo many of the Nobility and great Perſons, it is not to be wondred at, that their Language is better than ordinary. But the common Language of <hi>Bohemia</hi> is a Dialect of the <hi>Sclavoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> though very many ſpeak alſo <hi>High dutch,</hi> as we found in all our paſſage through that Country. <hi>Koningſmark</hi> being with his Forces on the Frontiers of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> a diſcontented Colonel of the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> came unto him, making it probable that he might ſurprize <hi>Hratſchin,</hi> and the leſſer ſide of <hi>Prague,</hi> which he ſuddainly attempted, and ſo ſucceſsfully, that he ſurprized many Officers, and old <hi>Colaredo</hi> in his Bed, getting ſo great a Booty, that he could ſcarce carry it away.</p>
            <p>A part of <hi>Prague</hi> is inhabited by Jews, and called the <hi>Jews Town;</hi> there are no ſmall number of them, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rich, as trading in all Commodities, and have good skill in Jewels, and ſeveral ſorts of Stones digged out of the <hi>Mines</hi> in <hi>Bohemia:</hi> I bought ſome <hi>Bohemian Topazes</hi> of them, neatly cut and well-figured, and ſome which were very large and clear, were at the rate of ſeven or eight <hi>Dollars.</hi> During my ſtay here, I had a great deſire to have ſaluted <hi>Johannes Marcus-Marci,</hi> a famous Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and Philoſopher of <hi>Prague,</hi> and alſo to have induced him to a Correſpondence with the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> but I underſtood that he had left this World, to the great grief of Learned Men in theſe and other parts.</p>
            <p>Many here do ſpeak ſtill of <hi>John Hus</hi> and <hi>Jerome</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> and I have ſeen <hi>Silver Medals</hi> of them. They were ſurely very notable men; and I ſhall only ſet down what <hi>Aeneas Sylvius,</hi> or Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the Second ſaid of them. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes aetate major &amp; authoritate, doctrinâ &amp; facundiâ ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57700:71"/> Hieronymus, pertulerunt ambo conſtanti animo necem, &amp; quaſi ad Epulum invitati ad incendium properarunt, nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam emittentes vocem quae miſeri animi poſſet ferre indicium: ubi ardere ceperunt, hymnum cecinere quem vix flamma &amp; fragor ignis intercipere potuit, nemo Philoſophorum tam forti animo mortem pertuliſse traditur quam iſti incendium. In Hiſt. Bohemica. John</hi> was or greater years and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>Jerome</hi> of more Eloquence and Learning: both of them endured their Death with great conſtancy, and went unto the fire as though invited to a Banquet: when they began to burn, they ſung an Hymn, which the flame and fire could ſcarce intercept. None of the old Philoſophers endured their death with ſuch a courageous mind as theſe the fire.</p>
            <p>The ſame Author compareth <hi>Prague</hi> unto the City of <hi>Florence</hi> in <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> wherefore having ſeen both places, I cannot omit to ſay ſomething. I had a view of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Florence</hi> from the top of the <hi>Domo,</hi> or <hi>Cathedral,</hi> and of <hi>Prague</hi> from the Church of St. <hi>Veit,</hi> upon the Hill in the leſſer Town: <hi>Prague</hi> ſeemed to my eye to contain a far greater Circuit than <hi>Florence;</hi> it ſeemed alſo more populous, and to exceed it very much in the number of People, the Streets larger, and the Windows of Palaces and fair Houſes being of Glaſs, looked not ſo tatterdly as the ragged Paper Windows of <hi>Florence.</hi> The River <hi>Arno,</hi> which runs through <hi>Florence,</hi> is not to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the <hi>Muldau</hi> at <hi>Prague,</hi> having run about an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles from its Head. The large, maſſy, long Stone-Bridge exceedeth any of, if not all, the four Bridges of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi> The Emperours Palace alſo upon the Hill is very ſtately: But as for the well-paved Streets of <hi>Florence,</hi> the <hi>Domo</hi> or <hi>Cathedral</hi> with black and white Marble, with a <hi>Cupola,</hi> ſecond only to that of St. <hi>Peters</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> for the incomparable <hi>Chappel</hi> of St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> and the <hi>Dukes
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57700:71"/> Gallery</hi> and <hi>Rarities,</hi> I muſt confeſs I ſaw not any thing in <hi>Prague</hi> which anſwered them. At <hi>Weiſſenberg,</hi> or the <hi>white Hill</hi> near <hi>Prague,</hi> that deciding Battel was fought <hi>Novemb.</hi> 8. 1620. between <hi>Frederick</hi> Prince <hi>Palatine</hi> of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> elected King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and the Forces of the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Second, which gave ſuch a deep blow unto the <hi>Proteſtant Party,</hi> wherein ſo many of <hi>Frederick</hi>'s Forces were ſlain and drowned in the River in their ſlight, wherein alſo that famous Commander <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penheim</hi> was found lying among the dead, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding died not of his wounds, but was reſerved to end his days with the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> in the memorable Battel of <hi>Lutzen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Prague</hi> I deſigned to paſs by water down the <hi>Muldaw,</hi> which uniteth with the <hi>Elbe</hi> about <hi>Melnick,</hi> and ſo down the <hi>Elbe</hi> unto <hi>Hamburg.</hi> But the Winter advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and the Weather proving cold, the Boats did not go as in Summer, and therefore I took my Journey by Land, and leaving <hi>Prague</hi> and the <hi>Muldau</hi> on the right hand, I paſſed the firſt day to <hi>Zagethal,</hi> the next to <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luerne,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Budin</hi> and <hi>Labaſitz</hi> upon the <hi>Elbe.</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving paſſed over the <hi>Egra,</hi> a conſiderable River, ariſing not far from the City of <hi>Egra,</hi> and at laſt running into the <hi>Elbe;</hi> the next day by the Caſtle of <hi>Kriegſtein,</hi> or <hi>Warreſtone,</hi> ſeated upon a high ſteep Rock, I came to <hi>Auſig,</hi> a ſmall City not far from the <hi>Elbe,</hi> having little remarkable in it, like many other ſmall Cities of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and ſo forward to <hi>Nolndorff,</hi> where we lodged upon Mount <hi>Kninſberg,</hi> the day after we entred into <hi>Miſnia,</hi> paſſing by <hi>Peterſwald,</hi> and <hi>Hellendorff</hi> the firſt Village in <hi>Miſnia,</hi> and <hi>Kiſibel,</hi> where are <hi>Iron Mines</hi> about eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Fathoms deep, and <hi>Iron works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We now underſtood that <hi>Bohemia</hi> was a larger Country than we expected; it lieth round, and ſome ſay it is three
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57700:72"/> days poſtage over; others that the Diameter extendeth two hundred miles. From <hi>Igla</hi> upon the Confines unto <hi>Hellendorff,</hi> it took me nine days Journey in <hi>November</hi> by <hi>Coach,</hi> not reckoning the time I ſtaid at <hi>Prague.</hi> In many places there are very ill Paſſages, and ſo rudely mended with great Trees, laid ſide by ſide, that they are often very troubleſome to paſs.</p>
            <p>We travelled afterwards towards <hi>Dreſden,</hi> in a fruitful Country, wherein were many <hi>Deer</hi> in moſt parts of the way, in ſight of the Caſtle of <hi>Pilnitz,</hi> a ſtrong place, and ſeated high. I could not but caſt an eye on the <hi>Rocks</hi> behind us in the Foreſt of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> which looked like the Ruines of a Wall which formerly encloſed <hi>Bohemia,</hi> which Country is deſcribed with a Foreſt or Woods round about it. But I confeſs I did not really perceive that there was ſuch a Wood round about it as is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet forth in <hi>Mapps;</hi> only both within, and alſo in many parts of the Borders, there are great Woods which are conceived to have been part of the <hi>Hercinian Foreſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Bohemians</hi> are a ſtrong, ſtout, and hardy People, make good Souldiers, and have made great wars both at home and abroad; and <hi>Hiſtories</hi> are full of their warlike Exploits. The chief <hi>Magazine</hi> of the King is at <hi>Egra,</hi> a ſtrong City, accounted the Second of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> The Country affordeth alſo luſty and ſtrong Horſes. The common ſort of People are boyſterous, rough, and quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, eſpecially in drink, whereto they are too much addicted. The Nobility and Gentry are civil and kind unto Strangers. There are many great Families of the Nobility, among which that of <hi>Roſenberg</hi> and <hi>Popel</hi> is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and of high eſteem. Since the unhappy accepting of the Crown by <hi>Frederick</hi> Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> and the ill ſucceſs upon it, there hath been a great alteration in this Country, both as to People and their Manners; for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57700:72"/> many thouſands left the Kingdom, and many who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, turned their Religion. And the Emperours have uſed the like ſeverity upon others in their Hereditary Dominions.</p>
            <p>The next conſiderable place we came unto was <hi>Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> in <hi>Miſnia,</hi> as well worth the ſeeing, as almoſt any Town in <hi>Germany.

               <hi>Dreſden</hi> is but a late City, and was formerly a Village. The <hi>Churfurſt,</hi> or <hi>Elector,</hi> was not in the Town; but the <hi>Chur-prince</hi> his Son was there: A Perſon rather of low than middle <hi>Stature,</hi> his Hair long and yellow, his Face ruddy, his Body well ſet and active, and he is very well beloved. The preſent Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> is <hi>John George</hi> the Second, <hi>Grand Marſhal</hi> of the <hi>Empire,</hi> a great and powerful Prince, who keeps a <hi>Royal Court</hi> and <hi>Attendance,</hi> having his <hi>Guards</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> after the manner of <hi>Kings.</hi> His <hi>Dominions</hi> lye in <hi>Miſnia, Thuringia Voytland,</hi> and part of <hi>Luſatia.</hi> His <hi>Revenues</hi> are large, from <hi>Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> upon <hi>Commodities.</hi> His <hi>Profits</hi> great, from the Tax upon <hi>Beer,</hi> which ariſeth to no ſmall ſum, eſpecially in <hi>Wittenberg, Torga,</hi> and <hi>Leipſick.</hi> And his <hi>Silver Mines</hi> are conſiderable. And the <hi>Funeral</hi> of the laſt Electour <hi>Joannes Georgius</hi> the Firſt, was very magnificent 1657. at which there were twenty four <hi>Horſes</hi> of <hi>State</hi> covered with <hi>black,</hi> and the Electoral <hi>Eſcutcheon</hi> embroydered
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57700:78"/> thereon, and every one led by two Gentlemen, and three thouſand five hundred perſons in mourning.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Luthers</hi> Holiday was kept when I was there. The chief Church is very fair: They preach every morning at ſeven a Clock. The <hi>Lutheran</hi> women mourn in <hi>white,</hi> as others do in <hi>Black:</hi> and the woman of the Houſe doth ordinarily ſay Grace inſtead of the man. The beſt <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutch</hi> is ſpoken in this place, and other parts of <hi>Miſnia,</hi> which is a very pleaſant fruitful Country, and full of good Towns and Villages.</p>
            <p>Leaving this noble place, I took not the neareſt Road, but turned out of the way unto <hi>Freiberg,</hi> a place noted for <hi>Silver Mines;</hi> whereof I had read ſomething in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gricola,</hi> and heard very much in theſe parts. About an <hi>Engliſh</hi> mile or two from <hi>Freiberg,</hi> there are many remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable <hi>Mines.</hi> I took notice of three of them: One called <hi>Auff den hohen berg,</hi> or <hi>upon the high Hill,</hi> which is the deepeſt in theſe parts, as being ſeventy ſeven of their <hi>Fathoms</hi> deep; each of their <hi>Fathoms</hi> contains twelve of their <hi>Ells,</hi> and three of their <hi>Ells</hi> makes one of our <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms.</hi> So that the depth of this <hi>Mine</hi> exceedeth any of thoſe wherein I was in <hi>Hungary.</hi> There is another <hi>Mine</hi> called <hi>Himmelfurſt,</hi> or the <hi>Prince of Heaven,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in not long ſince there was <hi>Ore</hi> found ſo rich, as in an hundred pounds weight to contain an hundred and thirty Marks of <hi>Silver,</hi> or ſixty five pounds in the hundred, but there was not much of it: And where the <hi>Veyns</hi> are richeſt, they are obſerved to be thineſt, about two ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers broad; but the ordinary <hi>Ore</hi> is but poor, holding an ounce, or an ounce and a half, in an hundred pounds weight; and if it holdeth but half an ounce they work it. Nor is this much to be wondered at, for in the vaſt rich <hi>Mines</hi> of <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Chili,</hi> they will work the <hi>Silver Ore</hi> which containeth four or five ounces in a hundred pound
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57700:78"/> weight, and ten or twelve ounces is the ordinary rate of the common <hi>Ore</hi> of that rich Mountain of <hi>Potoſi,</hi> out of which Hill alone, if we believe <hi>Albero Alonſo Barba,</hi> Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate of the Pariſh of St. <hi>Bernard</hi> in that City, there hath been more <hi>Silver</hi> taken than would cover all <hi>Miſnia</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and over: For thus he ſaith, Potoſi <hi>hath already yielded between four and five hundred Millions of pieces of Eight.</hi> A quantity ſufficient to make ſuch another Hill of <hi>Silver:</hi> It is hard to form a conception equal unto ſo exorbitant a heap of Riches; but the better to help our imagination herein, know, that if the Ground were cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſo many pieces of Eight, laid as cloſe to one another as is poſſible, they would take up the ſpace of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Leagues ſquare.</p>
            <p>Here at <hi>Freiberg</hi> they have many ways to open the <hi>Ore</hi> whereby it may be melted; as by <hi>Lead</hi> and a ſort of <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Ore</hi> which holds <hi>Lead</hi> in it. They have alſo <hi>Sulphur Ore</hi> found here, which after it is burned, doth help much towards the fuſion of <hi>Metals:</hi> And beſides theſe, <hi>Slich,</hi> or pounded and waſhed <hi>Ore;</hi> and <hi>Slacken,</hi> which is the Droſs or Cake, or Skum taken out of the <hi>Vortiegel,</hi> or <hi>Pan</hi> which receiveth the <hi>melted Minerals</hi> let out at the bottom of the <hi>melting Furnace.</hi> Their <hi>Treibſhearth,</hi> or <hi>driving Furnace,</hi> where the <hi>Litharge</hi> is driven off, agreeth better with the Figure of it in <hi>Agricola,</hi> than thoſe of <hi>Hungary;</hi> ſome of the <hi>Litharge</hi> is green: Their <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work</hi> and their <hi>Engines</hi> which pound the <hi>Ore,</hi> the <hi>Coal,</hi> and <hi>Clay,</hi> are alſo very neat. Much of their <hi>Ore</hi> is waſhed, eſpecially the pooreſt, and that which is mixed with <hi>ſtones, quarts,</hi> or <hi>ſparrs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is peculiar in their working, that they burn the pounded and waſhed <hi>Ore</hi> in the <hi>Roaſthearth,</hi> before they melt it in the <hi>Smeltzoven,</hi> or <hi>melting Furnace.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>At theſe <hi>Mines</hi> of <hi>Hungary</hi> where I was, they uſed not the <hi>Virgula divina,</hi> or forked Hazel, to find out <hi>Silver Ore,</hi> or hidden Treaſure in the Earth; and I ſhould little depend thereon: but here they have an eſteem of it. And I obſerved the uſe thereof, and the manner how they did it. But I ſhall omit the Deſcription of it, becauſe it is ſet down in divers Books, and it cannot be ſo well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed as ſhown to the Eye.</p>
            <p>I ſaw alſo another <hi>Mine,</hi> called <hi>Auff der Halſbrucker,</hi> about eighty of our <hi>Fathoms</hi> deep, and much worked: They have divers ſorts of <hi>Ore;</hi> but they contain either <hi>Silver</hi> and <hi>Copper, Silver</hi> and <hi>Lead,</hi> or all three; but they work them only for <hi>Silver.</hi> They have divers <hi>damps</hi> in theſe <hi>Mines,</hi> where it is deep. The <hi>Mines</hi> are cold where the outward Air comes in; but where not, warm. The greateſt trouble they have is by duſt, which ſpoileth their <hi>Lungs</hi> and <hi>Stomachs,</hi> and frets their <hi>Skins.</hi> But they are not ſo much troubled with water; and have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good <hi>Engins</hi> to draw the water out.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sulphur,</hi> or <hi>Brimſtone Ore</hi> which is found here, is alſo rich; it is hard and ſtony, as other <hi>Ores</hi> are: that which hath <hi>red ſpots</hi> is accounted the beſt. They uſe a peculiar <hi>Furnace</hi> to melt the <hi>Brimſtone</hi> from the <hi>Ore;</hi> ſome whereof yieldeth three pounds of <hi>Sulphur</hi> out of an hundred weight of <hi>Ore,</hi> which as it melteth runneth out of the <hi>Furnace</hi> into water, or the Exhalations from the <hi>Ore</hi> near or in the Fire, are condenſed into <hi>Brimſtone</hi> by the Surface of the Water placed to receive it; this is once again melted and purified. Some of the <hi>Brimſtone Ore</hi> containeth <hi>Silver,</hi> ſome <hi>Copper,</hi> and ſome both in a ſmall proportion.</p>

            <p>The other uſe, and which is more conſiderable, is for the making of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> or <hi>Copperoſe</hi> in this manner: They take the <hi>Ore</hi> out of which the <hi>Brimſtone</hi> hath been already melted, and burn it once again, or let it ſtill burn in the open Air; then putting it into a large Fatt, they pour water upon it, ſo as to imbibe and drink in the <hi>Vitriol;</hi> this Water is afterwards boyled to a ſufficient height, and let out into the Coolers, where ſticks are ſet in it, as in the making of <hi>Sugar Candy:</hi> The pureſt Chryſtallized <hi>Vitriol</hi> ſticks unto the wood, the reſt to the ſides and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. Thus the <hi>Sulphur Ore,</hi> after the <hi>Sulphur</hi> is taken out of it, ſtill worketh upon the <hi>Silver Ore,</hi> and openeth the Body of it in the Fire; but when this <hi>Ore</hi> is alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of its <hi>Vitriol,</hi> it worketh no more upon <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.</hi>

               <hi>Friberg</hi> is a round well-walled City; hath handſome Streets, a <hi>Piazza,</hi> the Elector's Caſtle, and five Gates. the Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi> is fair, where many of the Dukes and Ducal Family have been buried, and have fair Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; eſpecially Duke <hi>Mauritius,</hi> Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> whoſe Monument in <hi>black Marble</hi> is raiſed three piles high, adorned with many fair <hi>Statua's</hi> in <hi>Alabaſter</hi> and <hi>white Marble,</hi> and eſteemed one of the nobleſt, if not the beſt, in <hi>Germany.</hi> And when this Town was ſurrendred unto <hi>Holck</hi> and <hi>Gallas, Octob.</hi> 5. 1632. the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> paid 80000 <hi>Dollars</hi> to ſave the Monuments of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours from being ranſacked and defaced, it being the faſhion of divers <hi>German</hi> Princes to be buried in their <hi>Robes,</hi> with their <hi>Enſigns</hi> of <hi>Honour, Rings, Jewels,</hi> and the like, which would have been booty, and probably have run the ſame fortune as the <hi>Cloiſter</hi> of <hi>Haibron,</hi> within
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57700:82"/> twelve <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles of <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> where ſome of the Marquiſſes of <hi>Onſpach,</hi> who are of the Electoral Houſe of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> lye entombed, where <hi>Tillie</hi>'s Souldiers brake open the <hi>Vault,</hi> and robbed the <hi>dead Corpſes</hi> of the Marquiſſes, <hi>George Frederick,</hi> and <hi>Joachim Erneſt,</hi> of the <hi>Jewels, Rings,</hi> and other rich <hi>Ornaments</hi> with which they were entombed.</p>
            <p>There are ſome Vaults and Subterraneous Cavities in the City, by which there are paſſages into the <hi>Mines.</hi> This place was formerly ſtreightly beſieged by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Adolphus,</hi> for the ſpace of a year and a month, and at laſt betrayed by a <hi>Fugitive,</hi> who let in a party of the Emperours into the Town by a Subterraneous Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage near St. <hi>Donats</hi> Gate, and upon the continual Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries made at the Town, and concuſſion of the Earth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, the Earth ſunk down in many places, and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed great numbers of the Emperours Army.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Mines</hi> afford great benefit unto the City, and alſo unto the Elector; They are ſaid to have been found out in the year 1180. But there have been other <hi>Silver Mines</hi> diſcovered ſince; as at <hi>Schneeberg,</hi> at <hi>Anneberg,</hi> and at <hi>Joachims Dale,</hi> 1526.</p>
            <p>Having paſſed ſome time at <hi>Friberg,</hi> I ordered my Journey for <hi>Leipſick,</hi> and travelling by <hi>Waltheim</hi> and <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dick,</hi> came unto it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leipſick</hi> is ſeated upon the River <hi>Elſter,</hi> which ariſing in <hi>Vortland,</hi> or <hi>Terra Advocatorum,</hi> paſſeth by it, and afterwards runneth into the River <hi>Sala.</hi> It is a rich and great trading City; hath three <hi>Marts</hi> in the year, and great reſort unto it from many parts: It is well-built, and divers <hi>Houſes</hi> are ſeven ſtories high. The <hi>Caſtle</hi> is ſtrictly guarded, and hath in it a ſtrong white Town: But the Works about the Town are not very conſiderable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they might be made ſtrong.</p>
            <pb n="139" facs="tcp:57700:82"/>
            <p>The Church of St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> is well adorned, and hath the name to be the faireſt within ſide of any <hi>Lutheran</hi> Church in <hi>Germany;</hi> they have alſo a remarkable <hi>Burial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place</hi> or <hi>Godtſaker,</hi> walled about, and cloyſtered near the Wall, wherein the better ſort are buried, as the reſt in the middle and open part. Which put me in mind of that noble <hi>Burial-place</hi> which I ſaw at <hi>Piſa</hi> in <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> called <hi>Il campo Santo,</hi> becauſe the Earth which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Frederick Barbaroſſa</hi> brought from the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> for the Ballaſt of his Ships, was laid upon that Ground.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leipſick</hi> is famous for two great Battels fought near unto it in the laſt <hi>Swediſh</hi> wars; one between <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus,</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and Count <hi>Tilly,</hi> General of the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> 1631. wherein the <hi>Swedes</hi> obtained a great Victory. <hi>Tilly</hi> was wounded, fled, and lived not long after. Another ſome years after in the ſame place, wherein <hi>Leonard Torſtenſon</hi> the <hi>Swede,</hi> overcame Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke <hi>Leopoldus Gulielmus,</hi> and <hi>Octavio Piccolomini,</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of the <hi>Imperial Army.</hi> And about a mile and a half from hence, at <hi>Lutzen,</hi> another great Battel was fought, 1632. between the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> and the <hi>Imperial Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> commanded by <hi>Albert Wallenſteyn</hi> Duke of <hi>Friedland,</hi> wherein the <hi>Swedes</hi> obtained the Victory, but the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> was ſlain; and on the <hi>Imperial</hi> ſide that famous Commander, <hi>Godfrey</hi> Count of <hi>Pappenheim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is alſo an <hi>Univerſity</hi> at <hi>Leipſick,</hi> firſt occaſioned by the <hi>German</hi> Scholars of <hi>Prague,</hi> who in the troubles of the <hi>Huſſites</hi> came hither, to the number of Two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand in one day; and is ſtill one of the <hi>Three Univerſities</hi> in the Elector's Dominions; the other being <hi>Jena</hi> by the River <hi>Sala,</hi> and <hi>Wittenberg</hi> upon the <hi>Elbe.</hi> In this <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity</hi> they are much addicted to the ſtudy of the <hi>Law,</hi> but there are alſo Learned men in other Faculties.</p>
            <pb n="140" facs="tcp:57700:83"/>
            <p>The Magiſtrates of <hi>Leipſick</hi> are alſo conſiderable. <hi>Der herr von Adlerſhelme</hi> was the <hi>Burgomaſter,</hi> a courteous Learned Perſon, and great <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> who had collected and obſerved many things: He hath had five fair Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters brought up in all commendable ways of working, <hi>Drawing, Painting, Inlaying</hi> with <hi>Flowers,</hi> with <hi>Mother</hi> of <hi>Pearl, Stones,</hi> and other pretty <hi>Works.</hi> And they ſpeak divers <hi>Languages,</hi> which they learned at a School in <hi>Holland:</hi> So that his Houſe hath a great deal of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Furniture of his Childrens work, and is one of the moſt conſiderable Curioſities to be ſeen in <hi>Leipſick.</hi> His <hi>Summer-houſe</hi> is handſome, painted both within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out: And in the Water about, are <hi>Muſcovy Ducks, Indian Geeſe,</hi> and divers rare <hi>Fowls.</hi> In his <hi>Chamber</hi> of <hi>Rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> there are many things conſiderable: But I have ſeen divers of them in other places, and lately ſet down ſome <hi>Varieties</hi> of the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> I ſhall mention but a few.</p>
            <p>An <hi>Elephants Head</hi> with the <hi>dentes molares</hi> in it. An <hi>Animal</hi> like an <hi>Armadillo,</hi> but the Scales are much larger, and the Tail broader. Very large <hi>flying Fiſhes.</hi> A <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſe. Bread</hi> of <hi>Mount Libanus.</hi> A <hi>Cedar-branch</hi> with the <hi>Fruit</hi> upon it. Large <hi>Granates</hi> as they grow in the <hi>Mine.</hi> A <hi>Sirens hand.</hi> A <hi>Chameleon</hi> made out of a <hi>Fiſh.</hi> A piece of <hi>Iron,</hi> which ſeemeth to be the <hi>head</hi> of a <hi>Spear,</hi> found in the <hi>Tooth</hi> of an <hi>Elephant,</hi> the <hi>Tooth</hi> being grown about it. The <hi>Iſle of Jerſcy</hi> drawn by our King. A piece of <hi>Wood</hi> with the <hi>Blood</hi> of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt upon it. A <hi>Greenland Lance</hi> with a large <hi>Bell</hi> at the end of it. Much <hi>Japan</hi> painting, wherein their manner of <hi>hunting</hi> and <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> may be obſerved. A <hi>Picture</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> the <hi>Hatches</hi> of which are writing, or written, and contain the <hi>ſtory</hi> of his <hi>Paſſion. Bevers</hi> taken in the River <hi>Elbe.</hi> A <hi>Picture</hi> of the <hi>murther</hi> of the <hi>Innocents,</hi> done by <hi>Albert
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57700:83"/> Durer. Pictures</hi> of divers ſtrange <hi>Fowls.</hi> A <hi>Greenland Boat.</hi> The Skins of <hi>white Bears, Tigres, Hilves,</hi> and other <hi>Beaſts.</hi> And I muſt not omit the <hi>Garter</hi> of an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Bride,</hi> with the ſtory of it; of the Faſhion in <hi>England</hi> for the Bridemen to take it off, and wear it in their Hat, which ſeemed ſo ſtrange to the <hi>Germans,</hi> that I was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to confirm it to them, by aſſuring them that I had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times wore ſuch a <hi>Garter</hi> my ſelf.</p>
            <p>Leaving this buſie and trading City of <hi>Leipſick,</hi> I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected my Journey unto <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> and travelled through a plain Country, between the River <hi>Sala</hi> and the <hi>Elbe,</hi> by <hi>Landſberg,</hi> nigh to <hi>Peterſdorff,</hi> where there is a ſmall Hill which overlooks all the Country, ſo to <hi>Kihten,</hi> the Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Prince of <hi>Anhalt,</hi> then to <hi>Caln,</hi> and over the River <hi>Sala,</hi> before it runneth into the <hi>Elbe,</hi> which ariſing at <hi>Mount Fichtelberg,</hi> now haſtneth towards it. <hi>Fich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telberg</hi> is a conſiderable Mountain, near which are divers <hi>Mines, Bathes,</hi> and <hi>Mineral-waters,</hi> of which <hi>Gaſpar Bruſchius</hi> hath written a Deſcription. And from it ariſe four Rivers, running to the four quarters of the World. The <hi>Maine</hi> or <hi>Moenus,</hi> towards the Weſt; the <hi>Nab</hi> or <hi>Nabus,</hi> towards the South; the <hi>Aeger</hi> towards the Eaſt; and the forementioned <hi>Sala</hi> towards the North. Theſe four afterwards fall into the three greateſt Rivers of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> the <hi>Danube,</hi> the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and the <hi>Elbe.</hi> Then to <hi>Sals</hi> or <hi>Saltz,</hi> a placed noted for Salt-ſprings, and that night to <hi>Magdeburg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Parthenopolis,</hi> or <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> is ſeated by the River <hi>Elbe,</hi> formerly the Metropolitan City of <hi>Germany,</hi> now under the Marquiſs of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> of very great Circuit, but little more than half built again, ſince it was ſacked and burnt by <hi>Tilly,</hi> and Thirty ſix thouſand perſons put to the Sword and deſtroyed. I could not but obſerve the ruinous and deſtructive effects of the late wars in many
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57700:84"/> parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> but not in any ſo great and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a place as this: And a man might think, that after this great deſtruction of Houſes and People, this place ſhould not be able to ſtand a Siege; yet a few years after it was beſieged by General <hi>Hatzfield,</hi> unto whom (<hi>Bannier</hi> the <hi>Swede</hi> not being able to relieve it) it was yielded. The <hi>Cathedral Church</hi> is very fair, and built like an <hi>Engliſh</hi> one, by the Emperour <hi>Otho</hi> the Firſt, and his Empreſs <hi>Editha,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> woman, Daughter unto King <hi>Edmund,</hi> whoſe <hi>Effigies</hi> in Stone I ſaw in the Church, with nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Tuns of <hi>Gold</hi> by her which ſhe gave thereto. And to ſay the truth, <hi>Engliſh</hi> mony hath done great things in <hi>Germany,</hi> for hereby, or with a good part thereof, this Church was built or endowed. <hi>Leopoldus,</hi> Duke of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi> built the old <hi>Walls</hi> of <hi>Vienna</hi> with the ranſome of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt, whom he detained in his return through <hi>Auſtria</hi> from the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt ſent a great Sum of Mony unto the Emperour <hi>Adol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi> for the raiſing of Souldiers in <hi>Germany,</hi> which the Emperour employed in purchaſing a great part of <hi>Miſnia</hi> for himſelf.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches are handſome, and their Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits are extraordinary noble, and richly ſet off, as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, through all <hi>Saxony, Norimberg.</hi> And where they are Maſters of the Places, and have not their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches only by permiſſion; here they ſhewed me in the <hi>Cathedral Church</hi> of St. <hi>Maurice,</hi> the <hi>Statua's</hi> of the <hi>five wiſe Virgins</hi> ſmiling, and of the <hi>five fooliſh Virgins</hi> lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which are very well expreſſed: They ſhewed me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo two odd Reliques, which they ſtill kept as <hi>Rarities;</hi> that is, the <hi>Baſon</hi> wherein <hi>Pilate</hi> waſhed his hands, when he declared himſelf free from the blood of our <hi>Saviour;</hi> and the <hi>Ladder</hi> whereon the <hi>Cock</hi> ſtood when he crowed after St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s denying of Chriſt.</p>

            <p>I lodged at <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> in an old man's Houſe, who would tell me many ſtories of the <hi>burning</hi> of the <hi>Town,</hi> the <hi>cruelties</hi> and <hi>bloody uſage</hi> of the <hi>people,</hi> who were deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without exception: The <hi>Nuns,</hi> many of them being drowned in the River <hi>Elbe.</hi> After which ſome obſerved that Count <hi>Tilly</hi> never proſpered in his wars.

We were now in the Territory of the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg, Fridericus Wilhelmus,</hi> Great Chamberlain of the Empire, who is in effect poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> and next unto the <hi>Auſtrian Family,</hi> is the moſt potent Prince in <hi>Germany,</hi> being able to raiſe great <hi>Armies,</hi> and his <hi>Dominions</hi> ſo large, that they are reckoned to extend two hundred <hi>German</hi> miles in length, from the further part of <hi>Pruſſia</hi> unto <hi>Cleve,</hi> but they lay not together, but interſperſed with many other Princes
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57700:85"/> Countries: Howſoever, a Horſe-man may ſo order his Journey, as to lye every night in one of the Electour's Towns, in travelling from one end of his Territories to another.</p>
            <p>I had now left the <hi>pure German Language</hi> behind me, for at <hi>Magdeburg</hi> comes in another kind of <hi>German,</hi> called <hi>Plat-Deutch, Broad-Dutch, Niderſachſiſche,</hi> or the <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of lower Saxony;</hi> a great <hi>Language,</hi> ſpoken in the North part of <hi>Germany:</hi> They ſpeak it at <hi>Hamburg, Lubeck,</hi> and many great Cities: But they can converſe with the other <hi>High-dutch,</hi> and with ſome difficulty alſo with the <hi>Netherlanders;</hi> the one ſpeaking in his <hi>Language,</hi> and the other replying in his.</p>
            <p>At this City of <hi>Magdeburg</hi> was performed the firſt <hi>Turnament</hi> that was in <hi>Germany,</hi> which was opened in the year 635. by the Emperour <hi>Henry,</hi> Surnamed the <hi>Fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> who coming from the war of <hi>Hungary,</hi> exceedingly ſatisfied with the <hi>Nobility,</hi> would oblige them to exerciſe themſelves in handling their <hi>Arms,</hi> and managing their <hi>Horſes,</hi> and therefore inſtituted theſe <hi>Sports,</hi> whereby the <hi>Nobility</hi> was powerfully attracted to <hi>Valour</hi> and <hi>Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> and induced to perfect and accompliſh themſelves in all kind of <hi>Chevalry.</hi> No new <hi>Nobility,</hi> no <hi>Baſtard,</hi> no <hi>Uſurper,</hi> none guilty of <hi>High Treaſon,</hi> no <hi>Oppreſſor</hi> of <hi>Widows</hi> and <hi>Orphans,</hi> none born of <hi>Parents</hi> whereof one was of <hi>baſe Extraction</hi> and <hi>Ignoble,</hi> no <hi>Heretique, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, Traytor,</hi> no <hi>Coward</hi> that had run away from the <hi>Battel,</hi> nor <hi>indiſcreet Perſon</hi> that had given <hi>offence</hi> to <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> by <hi>word</hi> or <hi>deed,</hi> were admitted to this <hi>Honour,</hi> nor above <hi>One</hi> of the ſame <hi>Family</hi> at a time. <hi>Princes</hi> came into the <hi>Liſts</hi> with <hi>four Squires</hi> a piece, <hi>Counts</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi> with <hi>three,</hi> a <hi>Knight</hi> with <hi>two,</hi> and a <hi>Gentleman</hi> with <hi>one.</hi>

            <p>The hour and place for the <hi>Turnament</hi> being appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he that had a deſire to break a <hi>Lance</hi> there, came to the <hi>Preſidents Lodgings</hi> to have his <hi>Name</hi> written down, which was done in the preſence of three <hi>Heralds,</hi> to whom the <hi>Champion</hi> delivered his <hi>Helmet</hi> and <hi>Sword,</hi> and after he had been at Confeſſion, preſented himſelf in the <hi>Liſts</hi> with one or more <hi>Squires,</hi> according to his quality. The <hi>Horſes</hi> of the <hi>Combatants</hi> were to be without fault or exception; the <hi>Capariſons</hi> and <hi>Furniture</hi> ſuch as gave no offence; their <hi>Saddles</hi> without any extraordinary ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing before and behind, and all things equal. After which they performed all kind of <hi>Exerciſes</hi> on <hi>Horſe-back:</hi> and after the <hi>Jouſts</hi> were ended, every man repaired to the <hi>Preſident</hi> of his <hi>Nation,</hi> to wait for the <hi>Sentence</hi> of the <hi>Judges;</hi> and he that beſt deſerved the <hi>Prize,</hi> received it either from the <hi>hand</hi> of ſome <hi>Lady,</hi> or from the <hi>Prince</hi> that gave it.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Paſtimes</hi> were afterwards diſuſed, upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation it cauſed between the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Nobility,</hi> who ſtrove to outvie one another; or upon wars, in which there was no leiſure for ſuch <hi>Exerciſes;</hi> or perhaps upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that divers <hi>brave men</hi> loſt their <hi>lives</hi> in theſe <hi>Encounters:</hi> And no leſs a <hi>Prince</hi> than <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, King of <hi>France,</hi> neglecting to wear his <hi>Beaver</hi> down, was ſlain in a <hi>Turnament.</hi> And at <hi>Darmſtadt</hi> alſo, in the year 1403. at the Three and twentieth <hi>Turnament</hi> which was held in <hi>Germany,</hi> the Gentlemen of <hi>Franconia</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> drew ſo much blood upon one another, that there remained dead upon the place ſeventeen of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and nine of the latter.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Winter</hi> growing on called me to make haſte to <hi>Hamburg,</hi> from whence I intended to paſs by Sea into <hi>England,</hi> and therefore I took the advantage of the <hi>Stage-Coaches</hi> at <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> and in four days came to <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg;</hi>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:57700:86"/> I travelled through a Country for the moſt part barren, of little accommodation, or ſcarce any thing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remarkable, through part of the Electour of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> and then through the Duke of <hi>Lunenburg</hi>'s Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, paſſing by the City of <hi>Lunenburg,</hi> a handſome wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led City, beautified with divers fair <hi>Churches,</hi> with high <hi>Spires.</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> of St. <hi>Lambert,</hi> the <hi>Town-houſe,</hi> and the <hi>Duke</hi>'s <hi>Palace,</hi> are fair.

            <p>In this Road through <hi>lower Saxony,</hi> I could not but take notice of many <hi>Barrows</hi> or <hi>Mounts</hi> of <hi>Earth,</hi> the burial <hi>Monuments</hi> of great and famous <hi>Men,</hi> to be often obſerved alſo in open Countries in <hi>England,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times rows of great <hi>Stones,</hi> like thoſe in <hi>Wormius</hi> his <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Antiquities:</hi> And in one place I took more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar notice of them, where three maſſy <hi>Stones</hi> in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, were encompaſſed in a large ſquare by other large <hi>Stones</hi> ſet up an end.</p>

               <hi>Hamburg</hi> is a fair <hi>City,</hi> and one of the great ones in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many;</hi> it is ſeated in a <hi>Plain,</hi> being populous, rich, and remarkably ſtrong: It is fortified <hi>a la Moderne,</hi> much after the way of <hi>Holland,</hi> with <hi>works</hi> of <hi>earth,</hi> but in no place yet <hi>Reveſtues,</hi> or faced with <hi>brick</hi> or <hi>ſtone:</hi> The <hi>Territory</hi> belonging to it is but ſmall; it is divided into the <hi>new</hi> and the <hi>old Town.</hi> There are five <hi>Gates:</hi> The <hi>Stone gate,</hi> leading towards <hi>Lubeck;</hi> the <hi>Dome-gate;</hi> the <hi>Alten-gate,</hi> or which leadeth unto <hi>Altenaw,</hi> a place near the <hi>Town,</hi> belonging to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> where the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts</hi> have their <hi>Churches;</hi> the <hi>Bridge-gate;</hi> and the <hi>Dike-gate.</hi> The <hi>Buildings</hi> of this City are handſome, and commonly have a fair entrance
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57700:86"/> into them. The <hi>Senate-houſe</hi> is noble, adorned with carved <hi>Statua's</hi> of the <hi>Nine Worthies.</hi> The <hi>Exchange</hi> or place of meeting for <hi>Merchants,</hi> was then enlarging, it being too ſmall to receive thoſe <hi>Numbers</hi> which frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it. Many of their <hi>Churches</hi> are very fair, with high <hi>Steeples,</hi> covered with <hi>Copper.</hi> The Front of St. <hi>Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines</hi> is beautiful. The <hi>Steeple</hi> of St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with great gilded <hi>Globes.</hi> The other great <hi>Churches,</hi> are the <hi>Dome-Church,</hi> St. <hi>Peters,</hi> St. <hi>Jacob.</hi> The greater and leſs, St. <hi>Michael,</hi> the <hi>New-Church</hi> in the <hi>New town.</hi> The leſſer <hi>Churches,</hi> are St. <hi>Gertrude,</hi> St. <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> They have a <hi>Sermon</hi> every day, as in other <hi>Lutheran</hi> Cities.</p>
            <p>The River <hi>Alſter</hi> runs through it into the <hi>Elbe,</hi> and turneth many <hi>Mills:</hi> and the <hi>Tide</hi> comes up into divers Streets through <hi>Chanels,</hi> although it be diſtant eighteen <hi>German</hi> miles from the <hi>Sea,</hi> or Mouth of the <hi>Elbe.</hi> This place aboundeth with ſhipping, and many of good Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and is well ſeated for <hi>Trade,</hi> as having an open <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage</hi> into the <hi>Ocean,</hi> and being but a days Journey from the <hi>Lubeck</hi> on the <hi>Baltick Sea,</hi> and being ſeated upon the long River <hi>Elbe,</hi> the third great River of <hi>Germany,</hi> whereby it may have Commerce with a great part of that Country, and as far as <hi>Bohemia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hamburg</hi> is full of <hi>Strangers</hi> and <hi>Merchants</hi> of ſeveral Countries. The <hi>Engliſh Company</hi> have good <hi>Priviledges</hi> and a rich <hi>Trade,</hi> and <hi>Ships</hi> come laden thither with <hi>Cloath</hi> to the value of an hundred thouſand pounds <hi>ſterling;</hi> and they live here in good Reputation, and to the honour of their Country: they are <hi>Perſons</hi> of <hi>worth, courteſie,</hi> and <hi>civility;</hi> and I heartily wiſh them all ſucceſs in their <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</hi> I muſt not omit the acknowledgment of my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Obligation to that <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>worthy Perſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Griffin,</hi> Preacher unto the Company, Mr. <hi>Free</hi> the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer,

            </p>
            <p>This place hath the happineſs to be quiet when the great Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> are at war; for it deſires to hold a ſtrict <hi>Amity</hi> with Princes, and declines all <hi>Diſſention</hi> with them.</p>
            <p>I found a Ship at <hi>Hamburg</hi> bound for <hi>London,</hi> and while it was fitting for Sail, I made a ſhort <hi>excurſion</hi> into part of the King of <hi>Denmarks</hi> Country; and returning to <hi>Hamburg</hi> again, I ordered my affairs for <hi>England</hi> upon the firſt wind, and hoped the next <hi>Tide</hi> to get over the <hi>Altenaw ſand,</hi> and to paſs the <hi>Blanckneſs,</hi> but a croſs wind prevented, ſo that I left not <hi>Hamburg</hi> till the tenth of <hi>December,</hi> and then I had the good Company of Mr. <hi>Hoyle,</hi> who came from <hi>Narva,</hi> and ſet Sail in a new Ship; but the days being at the ſhorteſt, and the nights dark in the <hi>New Moon,</hi> the <hi>Tide</hi> falling alſo in the day time, we were able to get no further the firſt day than <hi>Stadt,</hi> or <hi>Stoade,</hi> upon the River <hi>Zwingh,</hi> a ſtrong <hi>Town,</hi> belonging to the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> where the Ships that come up the River pay Cuſtome, and where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants had formerly their <hi>Reſidence,</hi> when they left <hi>Hamburg</hi> upon a Diſcontent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>December</hi> the <hi>11th.</hi> we came by <hi>Gluckſtadt,</hi> belonging to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> where the <hi>Caſtle,</hi> the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Palace,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> are handſome, and Anchored that night before the Mouth of the River <hi>Oaſt,</hi> which ariſeth in <hi>Bremerland,</hi> and falleth into the <hi>Elbe</hi> a mile from <hi>Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>büttel,</hi> on the other <hi>Holſatian</hi> ſhoar.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>December</hi> the <hi>12th.</hi> we loſt ſight of the Northern ſhoar, and paſſed <hi>Cook</hi>'s <hi>Haven,</hi> in full hopes to put out to Sea that night; but about Three in the Afternoon we were becalmed a League and a half below it, where we were
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57700:87"/> forced to come to an Anchor again, leſt the ſtrong <hi>Ebbe</hi> ſhould ſet us on ground among the <hi>Sands:</hi> So we lay that night between <hi>Thickſand</hi> on the North, and <hi>Newark</hi> on the South, right over againſt a <hi>Light-houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>December</hi> the <hi>13th.</hi> the wind turning Weſternly, and blowing hard, we returned to <hi>Cook</hi>'s <hi>Haven,</hi> and came to Anchor. Here I came a ſhoar, and went up the Land to the Fort in this place belonging to the City of <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg:</hi> It is a high ſquare Work, with a double Ditch, and ſome <hi>Veſſels</hi> come up to the Fort; but the <hi>Ditch</hi> or <hi>Chanel</hi> which comes thither out of the <hi>Elbe,</hi> is dry at low water. The <hi>Town</hi> is called <hi>Reutſbüttel,</hi> not far from the Lands end. Two or three days after, with a cold North-Eaſt-wind, we ſet Sail for <hi>England.</hi> Coming out of the <hi>Elbe,</hi> we were all the Afternoon in ſight of an Iſland, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Heilige-landt,</hi> or <hi>Holy-land,</hi> belonging to the Duke of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> which being very high Land, is to be ſeen at a good diſtance, and is of excellent uſe to direct and guide Ships into the Mouth of the <hi>Elbe,</hi> without which they would be at a great loſs, the Country about that Rivers Mouth being all very low Land.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Heiligeland</hi> is a ſmall <hi>Iſland,</hi> having about two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Inhabitants,</hi> and ſix or ſeven ſmall <hi>Veſſels</hi> belonging to it, which are imployed a great part of the year in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Lobſters</hi> and other <hi>Fiſh</hi> to <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Quinborough,</hi> the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> living moſt upon <hi>Fiſh.</hi> We bore out to Sea all night, and the next day made towards the Land again, and ſailed in ſight of <hi>Schiemoniekeoghe, Amelandt,</hi> and <hi>Schelling:</hi> in the Evening we ſaw the Lights at the <hi>Vly</hi> and <hi>Texel;</hi> when we were near the Land, we were much troubled with the Froſt and cold Weather, and leſs when we were off at Sea. The next day we had a fair wind, and made ſuch way, that in the Evening we took down our Sails, and let the <hi>Veſſel</hi> drive, not being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57700:88"/> to deal with the ſhoar in the night. The next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we ſoon diſcovered the <hi>Northforeland</hi> covered with Snow, and came to an Anchor in <hi>Margarite</hi>-Road, where the wind growing very high, we rode it out for two days and two nights, and came ſafe on ſhoar (praiſed be God) upon <hi>Chriſtmas-day</hi> morning.</p>
            <p>Now having made ſo long a walk in <hi>Germany,</hi> I muſt confeſs I returned with a better opinion of the Country, than I had before of it; and cannot but think it very conſiderable in many things. The Rivers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are noble, and ſeem to exceed thoſe of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly.</hi> Of the Rivers of <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Padus</hi> or <hi>Po,</hi> is the moſt conſiderable, which notwithſtanding, hath no very long courſe, before it runneth into the <hi>Adriatick Sea.</hi> And <hi>Italy</hi> being divided by the <hi>Appennine-hills,</hi> running from Weſt to Eaſt, the Rivers which ariſe from either ſide, cannot be long, neither on the South-ſide, before they run into the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> as the <hi>Arno, Garigliano,</hi> and others: Nor on the North ſide, before they run into the <hi>Adriatick,</hi> or the <hi>Po.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The chief Rivers of <hi>France,</hi> as the <hi>Loyre,</hi> the <hi>Seine,</hi> the <hi>Rhoſne,</hi> and the <hi>Garonne,</hi> I cannot but highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, having paſſed upon them for divers days. There are alſo four great Rivers in <hi>Germany;</hi> the <hi>Danube,</hi> the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the <hi>Elbe,</hi> and the <hi>Oder,</hi> but none of <hi>France</hi> ſeem comparable unto the <hi>Rhine</hi> and <hi>Danube. France</hi> having the Sea upon the North, the Weſt, and the two large Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and <hi>Province</hi> upon the <hi>Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean Sea,</hi> hath the opportunity of Noble Cities and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports: But ſome doubt may be made, Whether any there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of do exceed <hi>Hamburg, Lubeck,</hi> and <hi>Dantzick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great number of populous, large, and handſome Cities, doth afford great content unto a <hi>Traveller</hi> in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many;</hi> for beſides about Sixty ſix free Imperial Cities,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57700:88"/> are many more of good note belonging to particular Princes, and divers highly priviledged. And ſurely a true Eſtimation of the Cities and Towns of theſe days, cannot be duly made from the Accounts and Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof left an hundred years ſince or more, for ſince thoſe times, Buildings have been better modelled and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; Fortifications and Out-works more regularly contrived; Convents and Publick Houſes more neatly and commodiouſly built; and the fair Colledges and Churches of the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> which are now to be ſeen in moſt, do much ſet off the Beauty of great Places. Every where we meet with great and populous <hi>Towns, Villages, Caſtles, Seats</hi> of the <hi>Nobility, Plains, Foreſts,</hi> and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant <hi>Woods.</hi> And beſides the ſatisfaction we may have from Objects above ground, we may find no ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in the wonders thereof under it, in <hi>Mines, Minerals</hi> almoſt of all ſorts, of <hi>Gold, Silver, Copper, Iron, Tinn, Lead, Quickſilver, Antimony, Coal, Salt, Sulphur, Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> and others, where there are alſo ſingular <hi>Artificers</hi> and <hi>Workmen,</hi> in the ſeveral Artifices thereof. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with the People is eaſie, they behaving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without much Formality, and are plain-dealing and truſty, ſo that a <hi>Traveller</hi> needs not to be ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous and heedful of what he hath, as in ſome other Countries, which are eſteemed of greater Civility. The Women are generally well-complexioned, ſober, and grave, and they have not yet learned the cuſtome of their Neighbours of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> to admit of being ſaluted by Men: faithful to their Husbands, and careful in the affairs of their Houſes.</p>
            <p>They make good proviſion againſt the cold of their Country, by ſleeping between two Feather-beds and Stoves.</p>
            <pb n="152" facs="tcp:57700:89"/>
            <p>The common <hi>Stoves</hi> in <hi>Inns,</hi> wherein there are for the moſt part ſeveral Companies eating, drinking, and in the night ſleeping, are convenient, conſidering the great cold, or at leaſt tolerable; but they being rooms cloſe ſhut up, the ſmell of the meat, and eſpecially of <hi>Cabbage,</hi> an uſual Diſh amongſt them, makes them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant, ſo that ſometimes I preferred the courſe of hot Countries, while I called to mind, that in <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> we drank frozen <hi>Julebs,</hi> which we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved with the heat of our hands; ſlept upon a ſheet, on the outſide of the Bed, with all the Windows of the Chamber open; and as we ſate at dinner, there was a Fann in the middle of the Room, hanging over our Heads, about two yards broad, which with a ſtring was pulled backward and forward to cool us, and divers had Pans filled with Snow, to cool the ſheets when they went into their Beds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Germany</hi> is a great <hi>Hive</hi> of men, and the mighty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of men made by the laſt <hi>German</hi> wars, and by the Plague is ſo repaired, that it is ſcarce diſcernible. They are fruitful, and full of Children: They are not exhauſted by <hi>Sea,</hi> Colonies ſent forth, or by peopling <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican Countries;</hi> but they have ſome conſumption by wars abroad, when they be at peace at home: few wars being made in other parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> wherein there are not ſome Regiments of <hi>Germans;</hi> the People being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally Martial, and perſons well deſcended, very averſe from a Trading courſe of Life.</p>
            <p>While I read in <hi>Tacitus</hi> of the old barbarous and rude State of <hi>Germany,</hi> how poorly they lived, that they had their Houſes at a diſtance from one another; how igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant they were in Arts; and it was doubted whether their Country afforded <hi>Mines;</hi> that they lived by exchange of things, making little or no uſe of mony, and the like,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57700:89"/> I may juſtly wonder to behold the preſent advance and improvement in all commendable Arts, Learning, Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſplendid and handſome Cities and Habitations, and the general face of things incredibly altered ſince thoſe ancient times; and cannot but approve the expreſſion of a Learned Man, though long ſince, <hi>That if</hi> A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

               <hi>July</hi> the <hi>5th.</hi> we came to <hi>Aken,</hi> or <hi>Aquiſgranum,</hi> ſive Leagues diſtant from <hi>Gulick;</hi> the <hi>French</hi> call it <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> from a <hi>Chappel</hi> in the great <hi>Church,</hi> much viſited by <hi>Pilgrims</hi> from many parts; and famous for the great number of <hi>Reliques</hi> preſerved therein.

This <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> beſides theſe Devaſtations from the Irruptions of the <hi>Huns</hi> and <hi>Normans,</hi> hath been divers times ſince de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by <hi>Fire;</hi> as in the year 1146. which loſs it overcame in ſuch manner, that Twenty ſix years after, it recovered not only its former greatneſs, but was ſo much increaſed, that the large <hi>outward Wall</hi> was built by the command of the <hi>Emperour Frederick</hi> the Firſt.</p>
            <p>In the year 1224. happened another great <hi>Fire,</hi> in which, not only the <hi>Buildings,</hi> but many of the <hi>Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants</hi> periſhed. And the <hi>Roof</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> was burnt in another <hi>Fire</hi> 1236. And now of late, for it is not long ſince it hath recovered its loſſes by the <hi>Fire</hi> in the year 1656. when twenty <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Chappels,</hi> and about five thouſand private <hi>Houſes</hi> were deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Town-houſe,</hi> or <hi>Senate-houſe,</hi> was built 1353. being all of <hi>Free-ſtone,</hi> handſomely adorned with the <hi>Statues</hi> of the <hi>Emperours.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond Story</hi> of this <hi>Building</hi> is divided into <hi>Chambers;</hi> but the higheſt is all one entire <hi>Room</hi> or <hi>Hall,</hi> 162 Foot long, and 60 Foot broad. It is well <hi>painted</hi> in divers parts by <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaga:</hi> Two Pieces of whoſe <hi>drawing</hi> are much eſteemed here; one of the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and another of <hi>Charles</hi>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:57700:92"/> the Great, giving the <hi>Charter</hi> to the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Aken.</hi> Here the <hi>Emperours,</hi> at the time of their <hi>Coronation,</hi> uſed to keep their <hi>Feaſts,</hi> together with the <hi>Electours</hi> and other <hi>Princes.</hi> The <hi>Roof</hi> is ſupported by <hi>four Pillars;</hi> through the middle of which, the <hi>ſmoak</hi> of all the <hi>Chimneys</hi> of this <hi>Building,</hi> is by a handſome contrivance conveyed away.</p>
            <p>Over againſt this <hi>Houſe,</hi> in the middle of the <hi>Piazza,</hi> is a <hi>Fountain,</hi> conſiderable both for <hi>largeneſs</hi> and neat <hi>ſtructure,</hi> contrived by a great <hi>Artiſt, Gerard Coris:</hi> where four <hi>Springs</hi> perpetually empty themſelves from above into a large <hi>Baſon</hi> of <hi>Copper,</hi> of thirty Foot <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter;</hi> from whence again it deſcends by ſix <hi>Pipes</hi> into a <hi>Ciſtern</hi> of <hi>Stone,</hi> handſomely engraved, and paſſeth to many other <hi>Fountains</hi> in the <hi>Town.</hi> On the top of this <hi>Fountain</hi> ſtands a large <hi>Statue</hi> of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, <hi>Patron</hi> of this <hi>City,</hi> made of <hi>braſs,</hi> and gilded over. He is in <hi>Armour,</hi> and looketh towards <hi>Germany.</hi> About the edges of the great <hi>braſs Baſon</hi> is this <hi>Inſcription:</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Church</hi> of our <hi>Lady,</hi> built by <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, is of an odd <hi>Figure.</hi> At the Weſt-end is a <hi>Steeple</hi> adorned with divers <hi>Pyramids;</hi> and on the top a large <hi>Globe</hi> and <hi>Croſs.</hi> From hence, higher much than the <hi>Church,</hi> paſſeth a <hi>Gallery,</hi> ſupported by a large <hi>Arch</hi> to a <hi>Cupola</hi> near the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57700:92"/> middle of the <hi>Church.</hi> At the Eaſt-end is alſo a ſmall <hi>Turret</hi> or <hi>Lanthorn.</hi> The inſide of the whole is adorned with <hi>Marble Pillars</hi> of divers ſorts, with <hi>Pillars</hi> of <hi>braſs,</hi> gilded <hi>Statues, braſs Doors</hi> and <hi>Partitions,</hi> and much <hi>Moſaick</hi> work.</p>
            <p>In the middle of the <hi>Church,</hi> where <hi>Charles</hi> the Great was buried, hangeth a very large <hi>Crown,</hi> given to this Church by the Emperour <hi>Frederick</hi> the Firſt. This <hi>Crown</hi> is made of <hi>ſilver</hi> and <hi>braſs</hi> gilt, adorned with ſixteen little <hi>Towers,</hi> and eight and forty <hi>Statues</hi> of <hi>ſilver,</hi> of about a Foot high, and thirty two which are leſſer. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe ſtand eight and forty <hi>Candleſticks</hi> to receive the <hi>Lights</hi> burnt here upon <hi>Feſtivals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of theſe large <hi>Crowns</hi> I have ſeen at <hi>Colen,</hi> and other parts; and it hath been an ancient Ornament in <hi>Churches.</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi> have a <hi>Crown,</hi> or large <hi>Circle</hi> much like this, in the middle of moſt of their beſt <hi>Churches;</hi> on which they hang many <hi>Oſtrich</hi> Eggs, and the <hi>Pictures</hi> of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> and <hi>Saints.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> do likewiſe imitate it in their <hi>Moſques,</hi> but inſtead of <hi>Pictures</hi> place Lamps.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Frederick</hi> the Firſt took up the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great out of its <hi>Sepulchre</hi> in the middle of the <hi>Church,</hi> and afterwards buried it again; partly in a <hi>ſilver Coffin</hi> under the <hi>Altar</hi> of the <hi>Quire,</hi> and partly near the <hi>Wall</hi> of the <hi>old Building,</hi> covering it with the ſame <hi>Tomb-ſtone,</hi> as before; which is here reported to have been firſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the <hi>Tomb</hi> of <hi>Julius Caeſar.</hi> It is of <hi>white Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and hath the <hi>Figure</hi> of <hi>Proſerpina</hi> upon it. Out of this <hi>Tomb</hi> of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, were taken up a great number of <hi>Reliques</hi> and conſiderable <hi>Rarities,</hi> which he had got together in his life time; ſome of them given him by <hi>Aaron</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> by the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> and others; divers of which are ſtill preſerved here: and theſe following we had the opportunity to ſee.

            </p>
            <p>Near to this <hi>City</hi> are many ſorts of <hi>Minerals</hi> found; as <hi>Lead ore,</hi> the <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Vitriol-ſtone, Iron, Coal,</hi> and <hi>Cadmia,</hi> or <hi>Lapis Calaminaris:</hi> With this latter we ſaw them make <hi>Braſs,</hi> or multiply <hi>Copper,</hi> in this manner. They take calcined <hi>Cadmia,</hi> or <hi>Calmey,</hi> as they call it, <hi>Copper</hi> from <hi>Sweden,</hi> and the melted droſs of both; to twenty eight pounds of <hi>Copper</hi> they put an hundred pound of <hi>Calmey:</hi> They put firſt into very large <hi>Crucibles,</hi> ſome old pieces of <hi>braſs</hi> and <hi>ſlacken,</hi> or the droſs, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Calmey</hi> and <hi>Copper,</hi> and let them ſtand in the Furnace twelve hours; after which, they put eight <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibles</hi> full into one, and let what will run over, the beſt ſinking always to the bottom; and then caſt it into a Frame made of ſtone, bordered with bars of Iron; and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57700:93"/> ſo run it into braſs Plates, which are afterwards cut in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with large <hi>Ciſſars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>hot Bathes</hi> are very much frequented at preſent. Within the inward Walls are three convenient ones: The <hi>Emperours Bath,</hi> the <hi>Little Bath,</hi> and the <hi>Bath</hi> of S. <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus.</hi> The <hi>Emperours Bath</hi> is in the ſame place, and fed with the ſame Springs with that in which formerly <hi>Charles</hi> the Great took ſo much delight, that he frequently uſed to ſwim therein; in which Exerciſe few were more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert than himſelf; and ſpent the latter end of his days here, and would often invite to the <hi>Bath,</hi> not only his Sons, but his Nobles, his Friend and Guards; ſo as it was cuſtomary to Bathe a hundred together in thoſe days. But now they are divided into leſſer Partitions. The <hi>Emperours Bath</hi> having five Bathing Rooms; and the <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Bath</hi> which cometh out of it three. Theſe are reckoned to be <hi>Nitro-Sulphureus;</hi> and ariſe ſo hot, that they let them cool twelve hours before they uſe them. From un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a great round Stone which covered a Well, in which there were ſome of theſe <hi>Hot Springs,</hi> I ſaw <hi>Brimſtone,</hi> hard, above an inch thick, and <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> and a petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Subſtance finely variegated, taken out.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe, near unto the inward Wall of the City, there are <hi>Baths</hi> which are not ſo hot as the former, eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be <hi>Sulphureo-nitrous:</hi> The ſmell of them is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what offenſive, and the water in the <hi>Ciſterns</hi> not tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. The firſt is the <hi>Bath</hi> of St. <hi>Cornelius,</hi> which hath two Receptacles. The ſecond, the <hi>Roſe Bath,</hi> ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from Mr. <hi>Roſe,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Aken,</hi> who built it. The third, <hi>Compus Badt,</hi> or the <hi>Poor man's Bath.</hi> Of this ſort of warm Water there is alſo a <hi>Fountain,</hi> much reſorted to, and drank of every morning in the <hi>Summer</hi> for many <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Diſeaſes.</hi> About a Furlong out of the South-gate of <hi>Aken,</hi> is a Village called <hi>Porcetum,</hi> or <hi>Borſet,</hi> from the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57700:94"/> great number of wild <hi>Hoggs,</hi> which formerly frequented that place; in which are many <hi>Hot Springs</hi> upon both ſides of a little <hi>Rivolet,</hi> and let into <hi>Houſes,</hi> where they are diſtributed into ſeveral <hi>Baths</hi> of <hi>Stone.</hi> There are fourteen of theſe <hi>Houſes,</hi> and twenty eight <hi>Baths;</hi> the <hi>Baths</hi> holding ordinarily about fifty Tuns of Water, each of them: the Water is clear and pleaſant, without any offenſive ſmell; exceſſive hot when it cometh firſt out of the Ground, hotter than the hotteſt of <hi>Aken,</hi> and is left to cool about eighteen hours before they uſe it. They uſe alſo an Inſtrument of Wood, pierced with many holes, to help to cool them ſooner, or to ſtir the Water when any one goeth in, whereby he is not ſo ſenſible of the heat. There are many cold <hi>Springs</hi> riſe near theſe hot ones, whereby they might be tempered; and ſurely the quantity of the hot Water being ſo great, no place might be made more delightful, nor no <hi>Baths</hi> more noble. The <hi>Turks</hi> in our times, do moſt of any Nation beautifie their <hi>Baths,</hi> and render them ſerviceable to their health and pleaſure.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Auſtria</hi> at <hi>Baden,</hi> the <hi>Sawer Bath</hi> is built after the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> manner, with a <hi>Cupola</hi> over it: and if any one hereafter ſhall build or beautifie theſe, they will yield to very few in <hi>Europe.</hi> At preſent moſt of them are of a ſquare Figure, of about five or ſix yards over; and the Houſes in which they are, very near one another. The firſt Houſe hath the name of the <hi>Ladies Bath;</hi> the ſecond is the <hi>Snake;</hi> the third and fourth the <hi>Sword;</hi> the fifth the <hi>Golden Mill;</hi> the ſixth the <hi>Fool;</hi> the ſeventh the <hi>Cock;</hi> the eighth the <hi>Great Bath;</hi> the ninth the <hi>Fountain;</hi> the tenth the <hi>Crab;</hi> the eleventh the <hi>World Inverted;</hi> the twelfth the <hi>Glaſs;</hi> the thirteenth the <hi>Angel;</hi> and the fourteenth the <hi>Roſe.</hi> There is alſo another in the open Air, called the <hi>Poor man's Bath.</hi> In the Street is a <hi>Well</hi>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:57700:94"/> or <hi>Fountain</hi> of theſe <hi>Hot-ſprings,</hi> of as great a heat as any I have ſeen; perpetually boyling or bubling. But of all theſe <hi>Baths</hi> Dr. <hi>Blondel</hi> and Dr. <hi>Didier</hi> have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſo particularly, as I need not to add any thing more, and particularly of their Uſes.</p>
            <p>Within two Leagues of <hi>Aken,</hi> in the Country of <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> is a <hi>Mine</hi> of <hi>Lapis Calaminaris,</hi> which we went to ſee, having a <hi>Corporal</hi> and eight <hi>Muſquetiers</hi> for our Security to paſs the <hi>Wood.</hi> This <hi>Mine</hi> heth over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Caſtle of <hi>Einenberg.</hi> As ſoon as I had delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a <hi>Letter</hi> to Mr. <hi>John Franck,</hi> Comptroller of the <hi>Mine</hi> for his <hi>Catholick Majeſty,</hi> he went along with us, to ſhew us the manner how the <hi>Cadmia</hi> groweth in the Earth, and other Curioſities. This <hi>Mine</hi> having been wrought Three hundred years, and being one of the moſt remarkable of that kind, it may not be impertinent to ſet down ſome particulars concerning it. It is about eighteen or nineteen <hi>Fathoms</hi> deep, lying all open like a <hi>Chalk Mine,</hi> of an Oval Figure; they digg at preſent in ſeveral places, and the beſt <hi>Calmey</hi> lieth between the <hi>Rocks,</hi> in the deepeſt part of the <hi>Mine:</hi> They have now found an excellent <hi>Veyn</hi> ſo placed, of eleven or twelve Foot thick, which they digg out with <hi>Pickaxes,</hi> with ſome difficulty, by reaſon that the <hi>Lapis Calaminaris</hi> is ſo very hard. The <hi>colour</hi> of this <hi>Stone</hi> is of a dark <hi>yellow</hi> and <hi>red,</hi> and hath <hi>Veyns</hi> of <hi>natural Brimſtone</hi> mixed thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in it. The <hi>Veyns</hi> of the <hi>Lapis Calaminaris</hi> being ſo large, they follow them not only in one place, but digg over one anothers heads, and frame their work into the ſhape of large <hi>Stayrs,</hi> and one throws up what another diggs, and ſo upward till they lade the <hi>Carts</hi> with it. Some of the <hi>Cadmia</hi> is blackiſh and dark brown; and there are <hi>Fluores</hi> between the Cavities of the <hi>Stone</hi> hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely figured, but moſt of a <hi>blackiſh colour.</hi> The <hi>works</hi>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:57700:95"/> about the <hi>Mine</hi> the moſt remarkable, are theſe: 1. An <hi>Overſhot-wheel</hi> in the Earth, which moves the <hi>Pumps</hi> to pump out the <hi>water;</hi> and this not placed in the <hi>Mine,</hi> but on one ſide of it, and a <hi>paſſage</hi> cut out of the <hi>Mine</hi> to the bottom of it, by which the <hi>Mine</hi> is drained; and another <hi>paſſage</hi> or <hi>cuniculus,</hi> out of the place where the <hi>wheel</hi> is turned, which lets out the <hi>water</hi> which turns the <hi>wheel,</hi> and alſo the <hi>water</hi> which cometh out of the <hi>Mine</hi> into the Neighbouring <hi>Valley.</hi> 2. The <hi>waſhing</hi> of the <hi>Ore</hi> or <hi>Stone,</hi> which they perform, as at other works, by letting the <hi>water</hi> over it, and ſtirring it; and this they do whereſoever they begin to work near the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> for there the <hi>Calmey</hi> is leſs, and more mixed with <hi>Clay</hi> and <hi>Earth:</hi> but the moſt remarkable <hi>work</hi> is the <hi>calcining</hi> of the <hi>Ore</hi> (for all our <hi>Lapis Calaminaris</hi> of the <hi>Shops</hi> is the <hi>calcined Calmey</hi>) and it is worth the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for they place <hi>Faggots</hi> in a handſome order firſt, and cover a large round <hi>Area</hi> with them, of about For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Fifty yards <hi>Diameter,</hi> upon which they place <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal</hi> in as good an order, till all be covered and filled up a yard from the ground; then they place ranks of the largeſt <hi>Stones</hi> of <hi>Calmey,</hi> and after them ſmaller, till they have laid all on; and then by ſetting <hi>fire</hi> to the <hi>bottom,</hi> the <hi>fire</hi> comes to each <hi>ſtone,</hi> and all is handſomely <hi>calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> From hence we went to <hi>Limburg,</hi> meeting with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>Souldiers</hi> upon the <hi>Road,</hi> who deſired mony of us, but did not attempt any thing againſt us, we being many of us together in Company.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Limburg</hi> is ſeated upon a high <hi>Rock,</hi> which overlooks all the Country, and a little <hi>River</hi> runneth almoſt round it at the <hi>bottom.</hi> The <hi>Avenue</hi> to the <hi>Town</hi> on the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide is difficult all along upon the edge of the <hi>Rock;</hi> and the <hi>Gate</hi> of the <hi>Town,</hi> over which is the <hi>Governour's Houſe,</hi> ſpreads it ſelf from one ſide of the <hi>Rock</hi> to the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57700:95"/> other, and locketh up the <hi>paſſage.</hi> Here we ſhew our <hi>Paſports</hi> from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Plenipotentiaries; and in the Afternoon had a pleaſant Journey to the <hi>Spaa.</hi> In the way we ſaw where the <hi>French</hi> Army had paſſed the Country towards <hi>Metz,</hi> having lain about a Fortnight at <hi>Vichet,</hi> after the taking of <hi>Maeſtreicht.</hi>

               <hi>Spà</hi> is a neat <hi>Villedge</hi> in the <hi>Foreſt</hi> of <hi>Ardenna,</hi> ſeated in a <hi>bottom,</hi> encompaſſed on all ſides with <hi>Hills,</hi> and on the North with ſteep <hi>Mountains.</hi> So that it happening to <hi>rain</hi> while we were there, the place was, in ſome hours time, filled with <hi>water,</hi> the <hi>Hay</hi> waſhed out of the <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,</hi> the <hi>falls</hi> in the <hi>River</hi> made even, and <hi>Pohunt,</hi> one of the <hi>Mineral Fountains,</hi> was drowned. There was not much Company when we were there, although it were in the hotteſt time of the year, which is moſt ſeaſonable for drinking the <hi>waters;</hi> by reaſon of the wars, and the danger of coming through the Country to them. But in <hi>Spà</hi> it ſelf all people are free from <hi>danger,</hi> all the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring <hi>Princes</hi> protecting it, and would count it very diſhonourable to diſturb a place, which by the <hi>virtue</hi> of its <hi>Mineral Springs,</hi> is ſo beneficial to <hi>Mankind.</hi> Theſe <hi>Waters</hi> are not only drunk upon the place, but are alſo ſealed up in <hi>Bottles,</hi> and ſent into many parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Coquelet,</hi> at whoſe <hi>Houſe</hi> we lodged, told me that he ſent it as far as <hi>Saragoſſa</hi> in <hi>Spain:</hi> and that he had at that time Thirty thouſand <hi>Bottles</hi> empty, and waited for a good ſeaſon to fill them, which is the <hi>hotteſt, dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi> time of the <hi>Summer,</hi> and the <hi>hardeſt Froſt</hi> in <hi>Winter;</hi> at which times the <hi>water</hi> is <hi>ſtrongeſt, ſparkling,</hi> and <hi>brisk,</hi> The chiefeſt of theſe <hi>Mineral Fountains</hi> are theſe, <hi>Geron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Saviniere, Tonnelet,</hi> and <hi>Pohunt.</hi>

               <hi>Saviniere</hi> is another <hi>Fountain,</hi> almoſt as far from the <hi>Spà</hi> Eaſtward, and built after the manner of a <hi>Tower:</hi> the <hi>Acidulae</hi> are not ſo ſtrong as the former.

            <p>Being at the <hi>Spà,</hi> we viſited <hi>Franchimont</hi> one After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, paſſing through a thick <hi>Wood,</hi> there is an old Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and good <hi>Brimſtone</hi> and <hi>Vitriol-works,</hi> the ſame <hi>Stone</hi> affording both; and I preſume may alſo make the <hi>Spa-water</hi> under ground, or at leaſt be a principal <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient</hi> in it.

            <p>From the <hi>Spà</hi> we croſſed over to <hi>Frapont,</hi> a <hi>Village</hi> ſeated upon the pleaſant River <hi>Uta,</hi> or <hi>Ourte,</hi> where we took Boat and went down a rapid <hi>Stream,</hi> yet one of the pleaſanteſt I ever ſaw, winding and turning between ſo many green Hills, in part of the <hi>Foreſt</hi> of <hi>Arduenna.</hi> We deſcended afterwards thirty or forty ſmall Falls in a long Boat made on purpoſe. The <hi>Oar</hi> or <hi>Paddle</hi> being only a ſquare piece of <hi>Board</hi> fixed to the end of a <hi>Pole,</hi> the <hi>Pole</hi> ſtanding perpendicularly in the middle of it. The delightful River <hi>Veſa,</hi> or the <hi>Weſdret,</hi> ſoon met us, and joyning together, we fell down with them into the <hi>Maes</hi> near <hi>Liege.</hi> Upon the Banks of theſe Rivers all the <hi>Arms, Guns,</hi> and other <hi>Inſtruments</hi> are made, for which the Country of <hi>Liege</hi> is remarkable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Liege, Luick, Leodium,</hi> or <hi>Auguſta Eburonum;</hi> Learned Men think this City to be ſeated near that <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> wherein two Legions of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> under <hi>Sabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and <hi>Cotta,</hi> were deſtroyed by <hi>Ambiorix,</hi> chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the <hi>Eburones.</hi> It is ſeated upon the River <hi>Moſa,</hi> which entring with two <hi>Streams,</hi> makes ſome pretty <hi>Iſlands.</hi> Three other ſmall Rivers ariſing in the <hi>Foreſt</hi> of <hi>Ardenna,</hi> are alſo here received into the <hi>Maes,</hi> whereby they have plenty of Fiſh and other Conveniencies. The City is very populous, and ſo it
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57700:97"/> hath been in former Ages, when as <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunay,</hi> ſacked it, and deſtroyed an hundred thouſand of the people.</p>
            <p>It aboundeth with fair <hi>Churches,</hi> ſtately <hi>Convents,</hi> and <hi>Religious</hi> Foundations, richly endowed, ſo that it hath been called the <hi>Paradiſe of Prieſts,</hi> and is in that kind the moſt notable in all theſe parts. The Palace of the Biſhop is a noble Fabrick, built by Cardinal <hi>Erardus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Liege.</hi> The <hi>Cathedral</hi> beareth the Name of St. <hi>Lambert,</hi> who being Biſhop of <hi>Maeſtreicht</hi> was murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Dodo</hi> and others, about the year 622. The See was afterwards tranſlated unto <hi>Liege</hi> by <hi>Hubertus,</hi> as it had been formerly from <hi>Tongres</hi> to <hi>Maeſtreicht,</hi> and the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of St. <hi>Lambert</hi> removed unto this Church, which is at preſent very noble, being built of a reddiſh Stone, very much carved without, and handſomely adorned within.

            <p>Of the Pariſh Churches that of St. <hi>John,</hi> and of St. <hi>Servaſius</hi> are fair. Of the Abbies that of St. <hi>Jacob</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Town, and of St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> built by Biſhop <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginardus</hi> upon an Hill out of the Town, are noble. There is alſo a Colledge of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Jeſuites, well-ſeated upon a Hill, where the Garden is handſome, and the Dyals made by <hi>Franciſcus Linus,</hi> are worth the ſeeing: And an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Nunnery handſomely built. In the Church of the <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lielmites,</hi> out of the Town, lieth the Body of our famous Country-man Sir <hi>John Mandeville,</hi> who, after he had travelled through ſo many parts, took an affection unto this place, and here paſſed the remainder of his life, and whoſe Epitaph, and ſome Rarities of his, are ſtill to be ſeen.</p>
            <p>Biſhop <hi>Notger,</hi> who was conſecrated by St. <hi>Gereon,</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Colen,</hi> and died in the year 1007. built the walls of this City, and being Tutor to <hi>Otho</hi> the third, he found means very much to beautifie it, to repair and build divers Churches, and endow them with rich Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, and let the River <hi>Maes</hi> into the Town, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ran upon one ſide of it.</p>

            <p>As their Churches are fair and numerous, ſo are their Bells and Chimes remarkable. In the Cathedral of St. <hi>Lambert</hi> there are eight large Bells, and twelve leſſer; and there is one ſo great, as it is ſaid to require Twenty four men to ring it. In the Church of St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Bells and Chimes are conſiderable; as alſo at St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> and the <hi>croſſed Friers.</hi> It is alſo an Univerſity, and was ſo famous in former Ages, that they ſtill take notice that at one time there have been Nine Sons of Kings, Twenty four Dukes Sons, Twenty nine of Counts, beſides many of great Barons Students therein.</p>
            <p>Their Speech here, as alſo at <hi>Spaw,</hi> is called <hi>Roman,</hi> and is a kind of old <hi>French,</hi> or Dialect of that Language, a great part of which is made up of <hi>Latin,</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> words: and they call the Neighbouring Language of the <hi>Dutch, Tuiſcon.</hi> But many ſpeak very good <hi>French.</hi> They have ſome Vineyards affording a ſmall Wine. The Hills about furniſh them with Quarries of good Stone, and of ſeveral kinds. They have alſo divers Mines and Minerals, and great quantity of Pit-coal for Fire, in ſome places fetched deep out of the Earth, in others nearer the Surface: and in one place I ſaw them beginning to dig where they immediately found Coal. Their Pumps and Engines to draw out the water, are very conſiderable at theſe Mines; in ſome places moved by Wheels, at above a Furlongs diſtance, to which they are continued by ſtrong Wood-work, which moves backwards and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards continually.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Citadel</hi> ſtandeth upon a Hill, and is of great Strength; It was built to keep the City of <hi>Liege</hi> under Subjection. For 1649. there being ſome diſturbances in the City, <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> the Elector of <hi>Colen,</hi> offering to come into the Town to appeaſe it, was oppoſed by the Conſul, <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobus
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57700:99"/> Hennet,</hi> who was ſoon after ſurpriſed and behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, together with <hi>Bartholomaeus Rolandus;</hi> the Conſul ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſworn the Elector ſhould never come in whilſt he were alive. And the <hi>Citadel</hi> ſoon after was ordered to be built. The Bridges are handſome: that over the great Stream of the <hi>Maes</hi> is very broad and fair, and hath large Arches. From hence we could read the Elector's name upon the Citadel, <hi>Maximilianus,</hi> although it were at a very great diſtance, the Letters were ſo large.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Liege</hi> we had a pleaſant paſſage down the Water to <hi>Maeſtreicht,</hi> paſſing by <hi>Argentau,</hi> a Caſtle ſeated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a high Rock on the right ſide of the River, belonging then to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> afterwards by <hi>Vichet</hi> in the half way, and then by <hi>Navagne,</hi> a ſtrong Fort in the <hi>Maes,</hi> which commands the River, and at that time did the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſervice; then by pleaſant Rocks on our left hand, wherein many Cuts and Paſſages have been digged, till we came in ſight of <hi>Maeſtreicht.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Town having been a little before taken from the <hi>United States</hi> by a ſharp Siege, was full of <hi>French,</hi> and had a Garriſon in it of about Ten thouſand men; and in the <hi>Market-place</hi> ſtood about Two hundred large Field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces. We ſaw the places where they had their Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and their Mines, and the Half-moon which the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> took: the Out-works were very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and many of them undermined. Colonel <hi>Storff</hi> ſhew'd us a handſome Draught of all the Works, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and Manner of taking of the Town.</p>
            <p>About a quarter of a Mile out of the Town we went into the great Quarry of Stone, which is one of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt ſure in the World. Between <hi>Padoa</hi> and <hi>Vicenza</hi> I had formerly ſeen the famous Cave of <hi>Cuſtoza,</hi> or <hi>Cubola,</hi> ſaid to be above Five hundred Fathoms in breadth, and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57700:99"/> Seven hundred in length, but this doth far ſurpaſs it: the Roof is very high and ſtately in moſt places, the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars not to be numbred, all very large; we paſſed two miles under ground amongſt them: No <hi>Labyrinth</hi> can be contrived more intricate, and yet all parts are uniform. The <hi>Floor</hi> all in a level, and the <hi>Roof</hi> in moſt places of the ſame height, and ſo much hath that uniform rule, which I ſuppoſe was ſet to thoſe who firſt digged, and ſo hath ſucceſſively been obſerved, added to the beauty of this place, that there is ſcarce any thing more noble. It put me in mind of the <hi>hundred Chambers of Nero,</hi> which he cauſed to be made under Ground in the <hi>Rocks</hi> at <hi>Baiae.</hi> And the <hi>Water</hi> which we met with in one place, made me think of <hi>Nero</hi>'s admirable <hi>Fiſh-pond,</hi> built in the like manner within the <hi>Earth.</hi> We came out again near to a <hi>Convent</hi> upon the <hi>Banks</hi> of the <hi>River,</hi> and returned by <hi>water</hi> to <hi>Maeſtreicht.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day we parted Company. Mr. <hi>Newton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ettrick,</hi> Mr. <hi>Grove,</hi> Mr. <hi>Carlton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Newcomb</hi> went for <hi>Aken</hi> and <hi>Colen;</hi> Mr. <hi>Bates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Daſton</hi> went up the <hi>River</hi> again to <hi>Liege,</hi> at which place, ſtaying a day or two to find a convenience to paſs to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> we were nobly entertained at a Dinner with <hi>Veniſon, Wild-boar,</hi> and other <hi>Diſhes,</hi> by that worthy Perſon and Learned Mathematician <hi>Franciſcus Sluſius,</hi> one of the great <hi>Canons</hi> of <hi>Liege,</hi> who alſo continued his high <hi>Civilities</hi> to us to the laſt <hi>Minute</hi> we ſtayed in <hi>Town.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Leaving <hi>Liege</hi> we ſoon came in ſight of <hi>Tongres,</hi> or <hi>Tungrorum oppidum,</hi> the moſt ancient place in all theſe Countries. <hi>Ortelius</hi> would have it to be called of old <hi>Atuatuca:</hi> It was a ſtrong hold before the coming of <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> into <hi>Gaul,</hi> and was afterwards made a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Station,</hi> and in proceſs of time became ſo great,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57700:100"/> that <hi>Attila</hi> the <hi>Hun</hi> deſtroyed an <hi>hundred Churches</hi> in it, it being at that time a <hi>Biſhops See,</hi> which in the year 498 St. <hi>Servatius</hi> removed unto <hi>Maeſtreicht.</hi> Many old <hi>Coins</hi> and <hi>Antiquities</hi> are ſtill found here; and part of an old <hi>Chappel,</hi> ſaid to be built by St. <hi>Maternus,</hi> Diſciple to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> is ſtill remaining. When the King of <hi>France</hi> made his great inroad into the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> 1672. he borrowed this Town of the Elector of <hi>Cologne,</hi> and then paſſed on to <hi>Maſeick,</hi> where croſſing the Country to the <hi>Rhine,</hi> by the ſides of theſe great Rivers, <hi>Rhine</hi> and <hi>Maes,</hi> he made that notable <hi>Incurſion,</hi> and quitted not <hi>Tongres</hi> till he had taken <hi>Maeſtreicht</hi> the year following. We dined this day at <hi>Borchloe,</hi> and lodged at St. <hi>Trurn,</hi> or St. <hi>Truden,</hi> a handſome little <hi>Town,</hi> ſo called from a <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Abby</hi> herein dedicated to that <hi>Saint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day we dined at <hi>Tienen,</hi> or <hi>Tilmont,</hi> on the little River <hi>Geet,</hi> once one of the chief Towns in <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant,</hi> but long ſince decayed. In theſe <hi>Plain Countries,</hi> in many places we ſaw ſmall <hi>Hills,</hi> or <hi>Sepulchral Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of the <hi>Ground:</hi> And near unto the <hi>Walls</hi> of <hi>Yienen,</hi> are three very remarkable ones, ſaid to be the <hi>Tombs</hi> of great <hi>Commanders.</hi> In the Evening we came to <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lovain</hi> is the chief <hi>City</hi> of that quarter of <hi>Brabant,</hi> which comprehendeth <hi>Arſchot, Halen,</hi> and <hi>Judoigne;</hi> an ancient and large City, pleaſantly ſeated upon the River <hi>Dele;</hi> it is of great <hi>Circuit,</hi> and the <hi>compaſs</hi> of the <hi>wall</hi> accounted above <hi>four miles</hi> about: but there are many void <hi>Spaces, Hills, Fields,</hi> and <hi>Gardens</hi> within it, which makes it very pleaſant and delightful. There are herein divers good <hi>Buildings, Convents,</hi> and <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:</hi> the chief whereof is the ſtately <hi>Church</hi> of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the <hi>Convent</hi> of the <hi>Carthuſians,</hi> the <hi>Hoſpital.</hi>

            <p>It is the great <hi>Univerſity</hi> of theſe parts, ſaid to have had its beginning about 926. but endowed by <hi>John</hi> the Fourth, Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and confirmed by Pope <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> the Fifth, 1425. There are Forty three <hi>Colledges</hi> in it; whereof the four chief are <hi>Lilium, Falco, Caſtrum, Porcus. Goropius Becanus,</hi> a Learned Man, and Native of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> affirmeth, That no <hi>Univerſity</hi> in <hi>Italy, France, Germany,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> is to be compared unto it for its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legant and pleaſant Situation. The <hi>Univerſity</hi> is under the Government of <hi>Rector,</hi> who is in great eſteem and honour among them. This <hi>Univerſity</hi> hath produced many Learned Men: But neither the <hi>Buildings</hi> of the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,</hi> nor their <hi>Endowments</hi> do equal thoſe of our <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities,</hi> and the Situation thereof ſeems not to exceed that of <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We travelled from hence to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> being moſt part of the way in the ſight of the very high Tower of the <hi>Church</hi> of St. <hi>Rombald</hi> at <hi>Machlin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Count <hi>Monterei</hi> was then Governour of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and reſided at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> the ordinary Seat of the <hi>Governours</hi> of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands;</hi> which <hi>City</hi> he had taken care to fortifie, and to make it more tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if it ſhould be attempted by the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Bruſſels</hi> we paſſed to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> where we were handſomely treated by Mr. <hi>Wauters</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hartop,</hi> and having viſited ſome of our Friends, the next day we paſſed the River <hi>Schelde,</hi> and took Coach in the morning, travelling through a fruitful, plain, flat Country, ſet with rows of <hi>Trees</hi> in moſt places, and arrived in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening at <hi>Ghent.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="176" facs="tcp:57700:101"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Gaunt, Gandavum,</hi> or <hi>Ghent,</hi> is eſteemed to be the greateſt <hi>City,</hi> not only of <hi>Flanders,</hi> but of all the <hi>Law-Countries,</hi> and challengeth a pace amongſt the greateſt in <hi>Europe;</hi> but at preſent it decreaſeth and decays ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than encreaſeth. And if <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth were now alive, he could not put <hi>Paris</hi> into his <hi>Gant,</hi> a greater Glove would not fit that City, which is ſo much increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſince his time. In <hi>Ghent</hi> are many noble <hi>Convents,</hi> among which the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> is one of the faireſt: There is a <hi>Cloiſter</hi> alſo of <hi>Engliſh Nuns.</hi> The <hi>Cathedral</hi> is ſtately, and the <hi>Tower</hi> belonging to it being very high, gives a proſpect of a pleaſant and fruitful Country round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. There are divers <hi>Piazza's,</hi> large and fair; in one of which ſtands a large gilded <hi>Statua</hi> of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, Emperour and King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who was born in this City. The whole <hi>Town</hi> is generally well-built, and the <hi>Streets</hi> are fair and clean. The <hi>Inhabitants</hi> hereof have been taken notice of to be extreamly given to <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> and for their ſakes a great many other <hi>Cities</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi> are puniſhed, and have in a manner totally loſt their <hi>Liberties:</hi> For the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to curb the Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humour of the People of <hi>Ghent,</hi> were put upon the Invention of building <hi>Citadels</hi> in <hi>Cities,</hi> whereby a few <hi>Souldiers</hi> are able to ſuppreſs any <hi>Commotion,</hi> or beat down the <hi>Town,</hi> ſo that here I ſaw the firſt <hi>Citadel</hi> that was built in <hi>Europe</hi> by <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth: It is not large, and the <hi>Baſtions</hi> little, and though of a Regular Figure, yet not ſo convenient as thoſe of latter days, ſince that Art hath been improved.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Ghent</hi> we paſſed by water about Twenty <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> miles to <hi>Bruges,</hi> a very elegant large City, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly a place of very great Trade, being within three Leagues of the Sea; ſo that from the tops of their high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57700:101"/> 
               <hi>Buildings,</hi> the Ships under Sail are viſible, and at the ſame time a Fleet of Ships, and a large Territory of a fruitful, pleaſant Country, cometh under your eye. It is fortified with Works of <hi>Earth</hi> and deep <hi>Ditches.</hi> The <hi>Convents</hi> are numerous: The artificial Cuts of <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> from this Town to all places, maketh it of eaſie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; and though it hath no <hi>Port,</hi> the <hi>Paſſage</hi> from hence to <hi>Oſtend</hi> by <hi>water</hi> is ſhort: And they are at preſent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Deſign of bringing Ships up to this <hi>City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oſtend</hi> is about Ten <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles from <hi>Bruges,</hi> ſeated upon the waves of the <hi>German</hi> Ocean, which waſh it continually on one ſide: And they have now contrived it ſo, as to let the Sea in almoſt round the Town for a great ſpace, whereby it is become much more ſtrong and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſible than before. For when I looked upon it, and conſidered what it was when it was beſieged by Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke <hi>Albertus,</hi> and taken by Marquiſs <hi>Ambroſius Spino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> 1604. with an honourable Surrender after three years Siege, I cannot but aſcribe very much unto their Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies from <hi>England,</hi> and the obſtinate Valour of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants, eſpecially the <hi>Engliſh</hi> under Sir <hi>Francis Vere. Sluys</hi> being in the hands of the <hi>States</hi> of the <hi>United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,</hi> and <hi>Dunkirk</hi> under the <hi>French.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> poſſeſs no other <hi>Port</hi> in <hi>Flanders</hi> but this and <hi>Newport;</hi> and this being the moſt conſiderable, they are now ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the <hi>Haven</hi> large, and are upon a conſiderable Work in order to the carrying of their Ships over into that Cut which goeth from <hi>Oſtend</hi> to <hi>Bruges,</hi> out of their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, by the means of a very great <hi>Lock</hi> or Receptacle of <hi>Water,</hi> which is to communicate with both; which, when it is finiſhed, may be very advantageous to the <hi>Traffick.</hi> of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands.</hi> This <hi>Town</hi> ſtands very low, but the <hi>Streets</hi> are ſtreight, large, and uniform</p>
            <pb n="178" facs="tcp:57700:102"/>
            <p>From hence I went all along upon the Sea-ſhoar to <hi>Newport,</hi> a handſome <hi>Town,</hi> with large fair <hi>Streets,</hi> but low built. There were then a great number of ſmall Ships in the <hi>Harbour.</hi> This place is famous for the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel of <hi>Newport,</hi> fought here by <hi>Albertus,</hi> and Count <hi>Maurice,</hi> wherein the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Forces loſt the day, and much of the honour of the Field was due unto the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> under Sir <hi>Francis Vere;</hi> ſince which time, although there hath been much blood ſhed in theſe Quarters, yet there hath not been ſo conſiderable a Battel ever ſince, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had alſo the fortune to do great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice hereabout at a fight called the Battel of the <hi>Sandhils,</hi> when a part of the Army of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which beſieged <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> fought with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Forces by <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> and overthrew them.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Newport</hi> we put to Sea, ſailing out of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and intending for <hi>England;</hi> but the wind being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high and contrary, after having been at Sea all the night, and had leiſure to take notice of the great number of <hi>Sands</hi> upon that Coaſt, in the morning we put into <hi>Mardike,</hi> where at preſent there is only a Fort of Wood juſt above the High-water mark, with ſome few Guns mounted. The other Fort, more into the Land, being demoliſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dunkirk</hi> is much increaſed of late, and the King of <hi>France</hi> hath not ſpared mony to render it conſiderably ſtrong. He hath very near finiſhed a noble <hi>Citadel,</hi> begun by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> while this Town was in their poſſeſſion, which hath the <hi>Sea</hi> on one ſide of it, the <hi>Haven</hi> on another, and the <hi>Sandhills</hi> towards the Land, which when the wind is at South-weſt, doth ſomewhat annoy it: To prevent which, the <hi>French</hi> have made divers Cuts and Chanels through the <hi>Sands,</hi> into which the Sea entring, doth moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten and fix the Sand, ſo as they are not ſo apt to fly. And
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:57700:102"/> every <hi>Baſtion</hi> is ſprucely kept and covered within with green Turf. Beyond the old Wall of the Town, there are now great Works drawn, which encompaſs ſo large a ſpace of Ground, that the Town is made bigger by half: And in this part ſtands the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nunnery, and many handſome Buildings. The new Fortifications are very large; and the Baſtion towards the North the moſt ſtately, upon which the King of <hi>France</hi> entertained the Duke of <hi>Monmouth.</hi> The Port is large, and capable of receiving a great number of Ships, but at low water it is almoſt dry; and there are ſo many Sands before it, that at that time the Sea comes not in any depth within a mile of it.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Dunkirk</hi> we travelled by Land to <hi>Graveling,</hi> where the Works are of Earth, large and high, the Church ſtately, the Streets broad, but the Houſes low, and at preſent not populous.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Graveling</hi> I came to <hi>Calais,</hi> from whence ſetting Sail in the morning, we came to <hi>Dover,</hi> and the ſame day to <hi>London.</hi>
